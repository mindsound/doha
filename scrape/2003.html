	 Applicant's statements concerning his intent or state of mind when he completed a security clearance application are relevant and material evidence, but the Administrative Judge was not bound to accept those statements at face value. Rather, the Judge had to consider Applicant's statements in light of his assessment of Applicant's credibility and the record evidence as a whole. Applicant's various appeal arguments do not demonstrate the Judge failed to comply with pertinent provisions of the Directive. The absence of vulnerability to coercion or blackmail is not dispositive because security concerns can be raised by conduct or circumstances unrelated to such vulnerability. A review of the record below shows Applicant had adequate notice that he was responsible for preparing for the hearing and for presenting evidence on his own behalf.

By operation of law, the provisions of 10 U.S.C. § 986 preclude a grant of clearance to the Applicant, absent meritorious waiver by the Secretary of Defense. Applicant requests a waiver and provides persuasive evidence of mitigation. Clearance is denied. Waiver is recommended.

	 Applicant waived evidentiary objections not raised at the hearing. An Administrative Judge's discretion to relax technical rules of evidence under Item E3.1.19 of the Directive's Additional Procedural Guidance is not unfettered. Administrative or official notice is the federal administrative law analogue to judicial notice. The Judge abused his discretion by agreeing to take administrative notice of two op-ed pieces. Party claiming error below must raises claims of error with specificity. Given the procedural posture of this case, the Board is unable to determine whether a report cited in the decision below was appropriate for taking administrative notice, or whether Judge's reliance on that report had any prejudicial effect on Applicant's right to prepare for hearing and present evidence on his behalf. Case remanded with instructions.

It is plausible that Applicant was not aware of the judgment when she completed her security clearance application, since she had moved to a new address. However, it is unreasonable to accept that she would not have been aware that she was more than 180 days delinquent on more than the one debt she reported, when she was more than two years delinquent on two additional debts and more than a year delinquent on two others.

	 A native of Egypt, Applicant exercised a benefit of that foreign citizenship after he became a U.S. citizen in May 2000. He renewed his Egyptian passport to avoid the inconvenience associated with obtaining a visa to travel to Egypt on his U.S. passport and for the financial savings afforded to Egyptian-citizen tourists when in Egypt. Foreign preference concerns are mitigated by his surrender of his foreign passport and demonstrated intent to pursue his life as a U.S. citizen. The foreign citizenship, and in some cases the foreign residency, of close family members presents little risk of undue foreign influence. None are agents of a foreign power or in a position where they are likely to be exploited by a foreign power. Clearance is granted.

	 Whether a person is eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship is a mixed question of fact and law. A person's belief, however sincere, that he or she is eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship is not competent evidence that the person really is eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship. Whether Applicant's wife is eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship now, or will be eligible to apply in the future, does not change the fact she currently is a Russian citizen and not a U.S. citizen. Given the totality of the record evidence, the Administrative Judge has a rational basis for concluding the facts and circumstances of Applicant's family ties with Russia raised security concerns under Guideline B. Absence of a particular disqualifying condition does not compel a favorable security clearance decision. Applicant's security eligibility does not turn on whether he needs a security clearance for access to classified information or for access to a secured area. Adverse decision affirmed.

Applicant applied for, and now possesses, a Lithuanian passport obtained solely for the purpose of perfecting his claim for his family's property in Lithuania.

He does not believe his drinking has adversely affected his judgment or behavior. In December 2000, he was charged with spraying graffiti on the walls of a local high school, conduct which he admitted when arrested.

	 In 1994, Applicant, who was 23 years old, was arrested and pled guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol. His driver's license was revoked for one year, he received a 60-day suspended sentence, and he paid a fine. Applicant has had no further alcohol-related incidents since 1994. He admits to drinking 1 to 10 beers twice a month and he states that, since his 1994 arrest, he has never driven after drinking. Nothing in the record indicates a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence. Applicant's behavior provides evidence of mitigating conduct. Clearance is granted.

	 Applicant, a dual citizen of Venezuela and the United States (US) from birth, exercised his foreign citizenship by using his Venezuelan passport to enter and exit that country on about an annual basis from 1994 to 2001. His use of the foreign passport was not intended as an act of foreign preference, but rather due to the advice of US embassy personnel that he should use his foreign passport to enter Venezuela as that country would not grant a visa to one of its citizens. He has since allowed his Venezuelan passport to lapse and does not intend to renew it, thereby mitigating foreign preference concerns. Potential foreign influence concerns presented by the Venezuelan citizenship of his father and dual citizenship (Venezuela and US) of his sister are mitigated by the permanent relocation of these family members to the US. Clearance is granted.

	 Actions of an applicant's parents should not attributed to an applicant who is a minor under their control and dominion at the time. Applicant's past military service for Austria and his receipt of Austrian educational benefits could be considered by the Administrative Judge in determining whether Applicant demonstrated a foreign preference. Possession and use of an Austrian passport involves the exercise of the rights and privileges of Austrian citizenship. There is sufficient record evidence to support the Administrative Judge's conclusion that Applicant has demonstrated a foreign preference within the meaning of Guideline C. Failure to satisfy a mitigating condition may be taken into account when assessing an applicant's claim of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances. However, failure to take affirmative steps to comply with a mitigating condition cannot be used to turn the mitigating condition into a disqualifying condition.

	 Although Applicant's financial difficulties were not due to circumstances entirely beyond her control, they were inextricably connected to her bi-polar disorder and her alcohol dependence--itself a consequence of attempting to self-medicate her disorder. While a loan from a friend (essentially a consolidation loan) permitted her to resolve the last of her past due debts just before the hearing, Applicant has mitigated her financial difficulties because both her recovery from alcohol dependence and her treatment for bi-polar disorder have included a focus on improving her financial standing, and she has put into place networks of medical professionals, family, and AA contacts to help maintain her sobriety and financial responsibility. Clearance granted.

Applicants have the right to receive a reasonable opportunity to respond to the evidence presented against them and to present evidence on their behalf for consideration in their case. That right can be waived or lost by failure to take reasonable, timely steps to exercise it. However, the waiver or loss of that important right should not be assumed or lightly inferred. Given the state of the case file, the Board is unable to conclude whether Applicant's right to respond to the File of Relevant Material (FORM) was violated or waived, or whether the Judge's conclusion that Applicant did not submit a response to the FORM within the set time period was based on legal error, was based an abuse of discretion, or was legally sustainable.

His parents have been granted permanent resident status in the U.S. in January 2000, but remain part of the time in Jordan as the minor daughters' permanent resident status is still pending. I conclude that it is unlikely that he is in a position to be pressured. Further, there is no evidence that Applicant would succumb to foreign influence if his family should be subject to duress. His reference attests to his good character and professionalism at work.

	 In 1974, Applicant received deferred prosecution for child molestation. In 1993, Applicant was found guilty of misdemeanor child abuse and sentenced to two years confinement. Because both incidents of misconduct are remote in time, the criminal activity is revolved in favor of Applicant. However, 10 U.S.C. § 986 prohibits the granting of a security clearance absent a waiver by the Secretary of Defense. Therefore, the Applicant's security clearance is denied. I do not recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. § 986.

	 While Applicant admits he failed to reveal a 1990 arrest for rape and a 1994 criminal charge of battery in completing an October 2001 security clearance application, his defense that he did not intend to falsify by these omissions is believable in light of his subsequent disclosures and the flaws in the government's claims and in the record. The government provided no support for the 1990 rape charge where he maintained he was wrongfully arrested and the charges were ultimately dismissed. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) report lists a 1994 battery charge, but contains no record of conviction. His criminal conduct can be mitigated as these 1990 and 1994 incident were dated and isolated as there is no evidence that he has subsequently been implicated in any other criminal activity. His work record demonstrates he is clearly rehabilitated. Clearance is granted.

	 Applicant admits to a pattern of drinking heavily on weekends over a period of many years. He denies problems with drinking, even though he reports that his supervisor advised him that his consumption of alcohol was affecting his dependability as he sometimes reported late for work after weekend drinking. Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in February 1991 and November 2000. In October 1998 he was arrested for public drunkenness. Applicant did not disclose his 1991 arrest on his Security Clearance Application. Applicant's 1998 and 2000 arrests occurred while he held a security clearance. While Applicant admits he drinks too much, he denies he has an alcohol problem and he declines to adjust his drinking. Clearance is denied.

He is seeking a Chapter 7 discharge in bankruptcy of $50,650.97 in unsecured debt, which had not been granted as of April 2003. Some of the debt is attributable to lack of income, but it is too soon to safely conclude that his financial problems are safely of the past, notwithstanding a doubling of his personal income in October 2002. Applicant elected not to reveal known financial delinquencies when he completed his application for security clearance, as he feared he would not acquire his defense-related job.

Given that these relatives have no ties to the government of Korea, I conclude that it is unlikely that they are foreign agents or in a position to be pressured. Further, there is no substantial likelihood that he would succumb to foreign influence if his family should be subject to duress.

	 Between 1995 and 2000, Applicant accumulated approximately $10,500.00 in delinquent debts including credit cards, late car payments, and clothing store accounts. He intentionally omitted this information from a Security Clearance Application (SF-86) in February 2002. He asserts much of his financial difficulty resulted from his own inexperience with money when he moved out on his own for the first time at age 23. His actions to resolve some of his obligations are too recent for mitigation, and he has no proven track record of successful money management. Applicant has failed to mitigate security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline F (Financial Considerations). Clearance is denied.

However, Applicant has not been able to payoff or substantially reduce any of his delinquent debts, which extend back as far as 1994.

	 Given the facts of this case, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Administrative Judge to conclude Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 3 was not applicable to Applicant's falsifications. The presence or absence of an Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying condition or mitigating condition is not solely dispositive of a case. Rather, application of a disqualifying condition or a mitigating condition requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole. Even if a Judge were to conclude that an applicant's disclosures had eliminated the applicant's possible vulnerability to blackmail, such a conclusion would not extenuate or mitigate the poor judgment, unreliability, or untrustworthiness inherent in acts of falsification. The absence of formal criminal charges does not preclude the government from alleging an applicant has engaged in criminal conduct and presenting evidence to support the allegation in a security clearance adjudication. Adverse decision affirmed.

	 Applicant emigrated at the age of 22 from Bosnia Herzegovina (B/H) to the United States during the civil war in B/H, obtained bachelor and master's degrees, and became an United States citizen along with her parents and sister. She now seeks a security clearance because she works for a defense contractor as an electrical engineer. She possessed a B/H passport prior to becoming a U.S. citizen, and retained it after becoming a citizen. Her only step-sister continues to remain in B/H where she has lived all her life, taking care of her ill husband and two children. Applicant renounced her B/H citizenship, surrendered her B/H passport, and obtained a U.S. passport which she uses exclusively for any foreign travel. Applicant demonstrates no foreign preferences or allegiances over those she owes to the United States. Clearance granted.

	 Nothing in Executive Order 10865 or DoD Directive 5220.6 indicates or suggests that an applicant must be granted a security clearance unless the applicant's conduct and circumstances fall under or implicate all thirteen Guidelines listed in the Directive. There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party has the burden of raising claims of error with sufficient specificity to enable the nonappealing party and the Board to discern what error the appealing party is claiming the Judge committed. Under the terms of the ASDC3I memorandum concerning possession and use of a foreign passport, Applicant's continued possession of an Iranian passport precludes a favorable security clearance decision. Precedential value of decisions by Hearing Office Administrative Judges discussed. Applicant's statement that he will allow his Iranian passport to expire in the future does not take his case outside scope of ASDC3I memorandum. Adverse decision affirmed.

	 Security concerns remain over Applicant's foreign preference based on his dual citizenship by birth, his foreign military service, and his use of his foreign passport (which he renewed) even though he had a United States (US) passport. In January 2003 he finally relinquished his Austrian passport. But his mere assertion of an exclusive preference for the US is insufficient to meet the burden of proof since he plans to maintain his dual citizenship with Austria. On the other hand he has mitigated the allegations of foreign influence. While his father is a citizen of Austria and his mother and sisters are dual citizens, there is no evidence that they have ties to the government, are agents of a foreign power, or in a position to be exploited. There is no substantial likelihood that his family ties would lead to a case of foreign influence over Applicant or the compromise of classified information or subject him to duress.

There is a rebuttable presumption the Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically stated otherwise. Under the particular facts of this case, Applicant was not entitled to application of Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 1. For purposes of Guideline C, a foreign preference can be shown by an applicant's exercise of the rights and privileges of foreign citizenship for reasons of personal convenience or expediency. Decisions by one DOHA Judge are not legally binding precedent on other DOHA Judges or on the Board. The Judge's adverse conclusions about Applicant's security eligibility are not arbitrary or capricious. Adverse decision affirmed.

	 Applicant was born in Iran and was a dual U.S. Iranian citizen who renewed his Iranian passport after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen. In the early 1980's, he served in the Iranian military. His mother, a permanent U.S. alien, is an Iranian citizen. Since coming to the U.S. in 1984, Applicant has made two brief trips to Iran. In June 2002, he surrendered his Iranian passport and denounced his foreign citizenship. The security concerns engendered by the foreign citizenship of his mother and the concerns about the prior possession of a foreign passport are mitigated. Clearance is granted.

	 Administrative Judge erred by finding that both sets of criminal charges against Applicant were dismissed with prejudice. Judge erred by drawing favorable inference from fact that one set of criminal charges was dismissed with prejudice. Judge erred by accepting Applicant's speculation about the motives of the mother of one of the alleged victims. Judge gave undue weight to testimony of Applicant's supervisor. There is considerable record evidence that runs contrary to the Judge's findings. Favorable decision reversed.

	 Applicant, who used marijuana from about 1976 to at least late 2000, falsely denied on security clearance applications completed in January 1994 and April 2001, and in an October 1994 sworn statement that he had used any illegal drug. At his hearing, he claimed to have used marijuana only once in his life, recanting prior admissions of marijuana use as frequent as once to twice a week. Applicant also did not disclose on his security clearance applications felony charges of breaking and entering in 1978 and assault with a motor vehicle in May 1982 as the charges had been filed and he did not want to hinder his chance of obtaining a security clearance. Applicant's heroism in saving the life of a victim of a crime in 1988 is in his favor, but it is not enough to overcome the risk of future drug abuse and the doubts for his judgment, trustworthiness and reliability caused by his repeated falsifications. Clearance is denied.

	 Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal. Neither the Board nor Hearing Office Administrative Judges have jurisdiction or authority over actions of security personnel conducting background investigations. Actions of security personnel cannot be considered unless a party demonstrates how such the actions of such personnel are pertinent to a factual or legal issue that falls within the jurisdiction of DOHA. A Judge can make a finding of falsification even in the face of an applicant's denial of any intent to falsify. There is sufficient record evidence in this case to sustain the Judge's finding that Applicant falsified a security clearance application. Adverse decision affirmed.

	 Applicant's application for a Latvian passport after his naturalization as a U.S. citizen--even if used only to prove his Latvian citizenship to secure title to ancestral lands illegally confiscated by the Soviet Union at the end of WWII--demonstrated an unacceptable preference for his Latvian citizenship. His failure to comply with the provisions of the "Money Memo" required revocation of his clearance. Substantial current value of ancestral lands--even if not readily accessible or of greater value to Applicant's descendants--subjected Applicant to unacceptable risks of foreign influence.

	 Applicant, a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor, used marijuana, cocaine, and LSD when he was 16 years old. After forsaking drugs, he completed high school and worked his way through college. In 1999, shortly before he was graduated, he used marijuana again on at least a couple of occasions and ingested ecstasy on approximately four occasions. Although he claims he stopped using drugs before he applied for his position with the defense contractor, Applicant admits that, as late as 2001, after starting his employment and having a drug screen, he inhaled "one breath" of marijuana at a social function. Applicant failed to establish that it is in the national interest to grant him a clearance. Clearance is denied.

	 In 1970, Applicant was convicted, pursuant to his guilty pleas, of two counts of grand larceny, a felony. He was sentenced on each count to two years imprisonment, suspended, with the sentences to run concurrently. He has been gainfully employed and has not been in trouble with the law since then. He has held a security clearance for a number of years. However, 10 U.S.C. § 986 prohibits the Department of Defense from granting Applicant a security clearance absent a waiver by the Secretary of Defense. Applicant's security clearance is denied. I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. § 986.

Federal government need not wait until an applicant commits a security violation before it can deny or revoke access to classified information. Even if Applicant does not require access to classified documents to perform his duties, having access to classified areas places him in a position of having knowledge of, and access to, sensitive matters that require protection no less than that accorded to classified documents.
