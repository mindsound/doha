	Thirty-seven-year-old Applicant is a Russian-born, naturalized U.S. citizen,
who has lived in the United States since 1998. He has substantially more connections to
the United States than to Russia. His parents and sister are citizens and residents of
Russia. Applicant's "closest family," his U.S. native-born wife and their three children,
reside in the United States. He owns a home and investments in the United States, and
has no interests in Russia. Upon learning of the security significance of maintaining his
Russian passport, Applicant surrendered it to his employer's security department and it
was destroyed. Because of Russia's continuing efforts at economic espionage, there
are enhanced security concerns, but those concerns have been addressed. Concerns
as to his security eligibility and suitability have been satisfied. Clearance is granted.

	Applicant is a  retired Air Force enlistee who co-purchased a residential home for
seniors in 1997 and operated it for a number of years as a proprietorship before he and
his wife encountered serious financial losses that prompted their personal bankruptcy and

financial misfortunes include the impending foreclosure of his home and uncertain IRS
acceptance of his pending compromise offer to settle his federal payroll tax liability.
Applicant's manifest judgment lapses associated with his joint incurrence of significant debt

	Fifty-four-year-old Applicant's financial situation started to deteriorate in 1994,

cards and lines of credit, with his acquiescence, to fund her gambling compulsion. On

casinos in the total amount of $75,600. Unable to keep up with payments because of

	The Directive is subject to general principles of statutory construction.  The disqualifying and mitigating conditions are not necessarily most analogous to statutes.  Rather they are examples of circumstances to assist in evaluating aspects of an applicant's case.  Disqualifying conditions 7(a) and 7(b) have a significant degree of overlap and one set of circumstances may raise security concerns under both conditions. The Executive Order and the language of mitigating condition 8(b) should be interpreted as consistent with one another. The language in the first is to ensure that a clearance decision does not create a stigma of disloyalty.  The second requires Judge to balance an applicant's ties within the US to his ties to a foreign person, organization or country in analyzing the extent to which an applicant might find himself in a conflict of interest.

alcohol-related offenses between January 2005 and May 2008. He received alcohol
counseling from a licensed substance abuse counselor and complied with all of the court
conditions imposed on him following each conviction.  He has since limited his alcohol
consumption to occasional drinking and has not abused alcohol since his last alcohol-

	Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a federal contractor. The record evidence
shows Applicant was denied access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) in 2005.
The other governmental agency (OGA) took this action based her involvement in drug-
related activity from 1997 to about 2003 or 2004, minor employee theft, and failure to fully
disclose her drug-related activity during the security clearance process. In 2007, she
completed her current security clearance application, and she did not provide a full, frank,

Applicant has done a magnificent job at building a new life and removing herself from an
unsavory environment where illegal activity was the norm, her deliberate falsification of the

	Applicant was charged with criminal conduct in four instances between
  1996 and 2004. All four cases were dismissed. In the most serious incident, she
  and her husband were arrested because the police were informed that her house
  was being used to distribute illegal drugs. Her son was subsequently
  incarcerated on charges of drug distribution, and charges against Applicant and
  her husband were dismissed. Applicant did not intentionally falsify her security

	Fifty-three-year-old Applicant's financial situation started to deteriorate in
1996, when he filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. His
petition was converted to Chapter 7, and his unsecured consumer debt was discharged
in 1997. His financial problems continued and in 2000, he again filed under Chapter 13.
It was dismissed and refiled, and in 2002, it was dismissed. He was employed overseas
during 2007-2008, and earned a largely tax-free salary. Upon returning to the United
States he was unemployed for 11 months, but continued to draw his military retirement
and unemployment compensation. His SOR-related delinquent accounts total
approximately $20,743. While he has made small payments on some accounts and
obtained a mortgage loan modification, he continued to ignore his other debts. He
claimed he was making payments to some creditors but has offered little documentary
evidence to indicate the existence of repayment plans or actual payments. Following the
hearing but before the record closed, he filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13.
Substantial questions and doubts as to his security eligibility and suitability remain. 
Clearance is denied.

they could not legally reside together in Mexico because he only possessed a visitor
visa. To remain legal, he made an application to Mexico for permanent resident status,
which might eventually lead to dual citizenship with Mexico. He cancelled his application
once his wife obtained her permanent U.S. resident visa. He maintained routine open
communications with his facility security officer about everything related to the marriage
and their efforts to legally reside together, either in the U.S. or in Mexico, until his wife
could receive her U.S. permanent resident status, although he failed to specifically list
his application for the Mexican permanent resident status. He entertained the
"romanticized" desire of eventually owning a residence in Mexico, a desire his wife does
not share. Concerns as to his security eligibility and suitability have been mitigated.
Clearance is granted.

	Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a federal contractor with a history of
financial problems. The record evidence shows Applicant's financial history includes
charged-off, collection, and past-due accounts. He attributes the financial problems to his
wife's unemployment beginning in about 2005 or 2006, when she lost her job as a nurse
due to her addiction to pain medication and related conduct, and she then turned to
alcohol. His wife abused credit cards during this period and hid their financial problems
from him. His wife has now been abstinent of both substances for several years. Applicant
has made some progress in addressing his delinquent debts, but the progress is of recent
vintage and he has substantial work to do. The record contains insufficient evidence to
explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns stemming from his problematic credit
history. Clearance is denied.

He also used it to view live pornographic activities, and to expose himself while participating in an adult internet site in 2006. When his company discovered his activities, he was terminated. Applicant also amassed approximately $500,000 in mortgage and credit card debt because of a failed real estate business. Applicant made substantial efforts to sell his properties, and his mortgage debts are resolved under state law.

In addition, in January 2006, he was involved in an incident where he shot two Iraqi nationals, although it appears his actions were in self-defense. Applicant did not report the shooting to his employer or to an appropriate U.S. authority. The shooting incident was discovered in June 2006, when his employer learned of it indirectly; the employer then reported it to the Defense Department. In May 2008, a law-enforcement investigation determined there was insufficient evidence to prove or disprove the death of an Iraqi national and the aggravated assault of a second Iraqi national did or did not occur. Taken together, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant's wrongful possession of the firearms and his failure to timely report the shooting incident to his employer or appropriate U.S. authority raise unanswered questions about his suitability or fitness for a security clearance.
