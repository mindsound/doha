	 There is rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge is fair and impartial. Research and proof of foreign law poses various problems that make it generally inappropriate to be the subject of administrative notice. There is no right to a security clearance. Judge must make findings and draw inferences and conclusions that reflect a reasonable interpretation of record evidence. Department Counsel does not have burden of disproving applicability of Adjudicative Guideline mitigating conditions. Guideline B (Foreign Influence) is not limited to situations involving coercive means of influence. Given totality of Applicant's conduct and his strong, long-term ties with a foreign country, Applicant has heavy burden of persuasion that he should get a security clearance. Judge can consider whether an applicant has satisfied the requirements of ASDC3I memo. Favorable decision reversed.

	 Administrative Judge's decision about allowing a post-hearing submission can be reviewed to determine whether it was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Department Counsel does not have burden of disproving Adjudicative Guidelines mitigating conditions. Obtaining a foreign country passport is an act of exercising the rights or privileges of a citizen of that foreign country. Getting a foreign passport to protect the applicant's ability to claim the rights and privileges of a citizen of that foreign country is demonstrating a tangible interest in exercising the rights and privileges of a foreign citizen.

	 Neither a Hearing Office Administrative Judge nor the Board has the jurisdiction or authority to adjudicate the manner in which DOHA personnel decide to issue or not issue Statements of Reasons (SORs), to order DOHA personnel to issue or not issue SORs, or to dismiss an SOR. Department Counsel is not required to prove that Applicant's possession of a foreign passport poses a "clear and present danger" to the national security. The absence of security violations does not preclude an adverse decision based on other grounds. The federal government is not equitably estopped from denying or revoking a security clearance.

	 Whether Administrative Judge can apply a particular mitigating condition does not turn on what is alleged in the Statement of Reasons, but on what the record evidence shows. Judge erred by relying on earlier version of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1. Once Department Counsel demonstrates that an applicant's circumstances raise a security concern under the Directive, the applicant has the burden of demonstrating extenuation or mitigation of that security concern. Under ASDC3I memorandum, surrender of foreign passport is achieved by returning the passport to the issuing authority (or whatever other person or entity is authorized by law), not by giving the passport to a third party or entity. Board does not have jurisdiction or authority to pass judgment on the wisdom or desirability of guidance provided by the ASDC3I.

Memorandum by ASDC3I providing guidance about adjudicative standards supersedes any interpretation of those standards by Appeal Board.

Conditional willingness to renounce foreign citizenship is entitled to less weight than an unconditional willingness to do so. Security significance of Applicant's family ties in a foreign country is not limited to consideration of whether Applicant can be coerced because of those family ties. Security significance of an applicant's family ties in a foreign country does not turn on the simple question of whether the applicant's relatives have official ties with a foreign government.

Factors other than demeanor and inflection go into the decision whether or not to believe a witness.

An applicant's intent or state of mind can be proven by circumstantial evidence even in the face of denials that the applicant acted with a particular intent or state of mind.

Guidance from Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASDC3I) concerning adjudicative standards supersedes any interpretation of those standards by the Board. According to ASDC3I memorandum, possession or use of foreign passport is disqualifying unless it has the official approval of the United States Government.

A Judge's conclusions must follow rationally from the Judge's factual findings. Statement of Reasons (SOR) is not judged by strict standards of a criminal indictment. In assessing sufficiency of an SOR, it is necessary to balance the need for fair notice to an applicant against the need to avoid transforming SOR pleadings into a game of wits in which a minor or technical misstep is decisive. An SOR allegation may rationally be included under more than one Criterion.
