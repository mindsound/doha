	<p class="digest">
	 Applicant was arrested and charged with alien smuggling in violation of 8 U.S.C.  1324 (a felony) in 2001, but was never prosecuted for the offense. The evidence was insufficiently developed to warrant findings of knowing or reckless transporting of undocumented aliens into the U.S., and the substantive allegations, accordingly, are unsubstantiated. Of added security concern are Applicant's omission of his arrest/charge in the e-qip he completed in April 2007. Applicant's explanations for not listing the arrest (unaware of any arrest, mistaken understanding of the arrest date, and checking state records but not federal records) were insufficiently credible under all of the circumstances considered to avert findings of falsification. He did not correct his omissions until confronted. Accordingly, Applicant's arrest omission is not mitigated under the personal conduct guideline, although, the criminal implications of the omission are mitigated. Clearance is denied.

	 A Judge's failure to discuss a significant aspect of a case that reasonably could be expected to be taken into account raises a serious question as to whether the Judge forgot that aspect, ignored it, failed to appreciate its significance, or engaged in arbitrary or capricious analysis. The $100,000 personal loan is important because of its size and nature and the fact that Applicant had been unable to make payments on it since November 2007 and would not be able to make payments at least until later in 2008. The debt is significant because Applicant cannot identify what he did with the proceeds of the loan. The money was borrowed between 2002 and 2007. Applicant can only attribute its use to financial bleeding. There is no evidence that it has been used to satisfy the delinquencies in the SOR. This calls into question Applicant's ability to live within his means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations. The record does not support the Judge's application of MC 20(a). While Applicant testified about his financial difficulties in 2002, he did not demonstrate that the delinquencies in the SOR were from that period. Three of the delinquencies arose from his purchase of a larger home in 2005, which Applicant now says was not a wise choice. The record does not support a conclusion that Applicant's debts are under control or that he has made a good-faith effort to pay them off. The Judge apparently gave considerable weight to Applicant's plan for paying off his debts after his wife has finished training and gets a new job. The Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. The Judge's whole-person analysis fails to consider important aspects of the case that reasonably should have been addressed. Most notably, Applicant borrowed more than $100,000 in personal loans from a friend between 2002 and 2007, and cannot explain how he expended these proceeds or why he needed to borrow such a large amount.

He has had little, if any, relationship with them since he left Taiwan in 1982, and since their father died in 2007, their relationship has consisted of only infrequent telephone contacts. By the very nature of the Taiwanese Government, while Taiwan is believed to be an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence and proprietary information, there is no evidence that Taiwan uses coercive measures to gain access to such information. Thus, the fear of a "heightened risk" because of the presence of his brothers in Taiwan is not substantiated. His renewal and one-time use of a Taiwan passport was brought about by erroneous information, and the passport has been destroyed.

His relationship with his various extended-family members who are Taiwanese citizen-residents is varied. Some are historically non-existent relationships, some are limited to extremely rare visits with periodic telephone contacts, and some are generally limited to infrequent telephone contacts. By the very nature of the Taiwanese Government, while Taiwan is believed to be an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence and proprietary information, there is no evidence that Taiwan uses coercive measures to gain access to such information. Thus, the fear of a "heightened risk" because of the presence of some extended-family members still residing in Taiwan is unfounded.

	 Applicant's bad debts did not originate from causes outside his control. Department Counsel cites Applicant's decision to pay tuition costs by means of a credit card and his having been fired due to having not mastered his job. These circumstances appear to have resulted from Applicant's own conduct rather than from events that intruded upon him. The fact that Applicant has permitted the three remaining debts to linger despite a net worth in excess of $200,000 undermines the Judge's conclusion that he has acted reasonably in response to his debts. There is no record evidence of financial counseling, nor does the record support a conclusion that there are "clear indications" that Applicant's financial problems are being resolved. The Board notes Applicant's testimony at the hearing that he does not keep track of his finances, having turned that responsibility over to his wife. Applicant has not demonstrated a good faith effort to pay off his delinquent debts, relying on the statute of limitations and the fact that his debts have been charged off.

	 Applicant's renewal and use of his Nigerian passport after receiving his U.S. citizenship, and failure to take action to renounce his citizenship precludes a finding for Applicant under the foreign preference guideline. Applicant has failed to mitigate the extensive foreign ties he has to Nigeria through his family members on his stepmother's side of the family, and his mother-in-law's side of the family. Because Applicant continues to believe he did not falsify his security form in November 2006, the personal conduct guideline is found against him.

	 Forty-nine-year-old Applicant invested in a limited partnership business venture in about 1982 when such investments were considered legitimate by the IRS. He invested several thousand dollars on an annual basis, and in his income tax returns, claimed the appropriate business deductions, resulting in tax credits and business losses. The IRS subsequently determined the investments were no longer permissible and, following audits, he was assessed large interest and penalty balances for the tax years 1982-86, and large deficiencies were proposed for the tax years 1987-1995. Tax liens were filed and levies were placed. By a combination of agreed payment arrangements and overpaid income taxes, as well as by selling other assets, he satisfied many of the lien balances imposed, and they were released. The liens for the period 1982-85 were refiled in December 1998 and are expected to expire in December 2008 without further action by the IRS. His actions indicate good-faith efforts on his part as well as showing clear indications any problem is now largely under control. Concerns as to his security eligibility and suitability have been satisfied. Clearance is granted.

	 The Judge's statements that had Applicant initially been truthful about his marijuana use, he would have been denied his clearance, and that his falsifications were the sole determining factor in the granting of his clearance are problematic. Such language is not the product of reasonable inference, and was speculative. The Board does not evaluate a passage in a decision in isolation. The Board will evaluate passages with reference to the decision as a whole, when determining if the language has any harmful effect. The gravamen of the Judge's adverse security decision was his finding that Applicant deliberately concealed his drug use from the government and did so to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government interests. The Judge also stressed the importance of truthfulness and honesty in those persons who hold clearances and the desirability of giving clearances to those persons who are willing to be scrupulously honest in dealing with classified information. The Judge's doubts about Applicant's ability to be trustworthy under such circumstances serve as an adequate basis for his ultimate decision. Applicant correctly points out that the Judge's decision was bereft of any mention of Guideline J mitigating factors. As the Judge concluded that Guideline J disqualifying factors were operative in the case, he was obligated to give some indication that he considered Guideline J mitigating factors. Failure to do so was error. However, the Board views this error as ultimately harmless in that the Judge's ultimate decision is supportable given his sustainable analysis under Guideline E.

With respect to two other debts the Judge found Applicant had no success in obtaining financial information from listed creditors. The Judge found that Applicant is barely able to pay her current bills with her current take home pay and living expenses and is considering bankruptcy. As a result, the Judge concluded that she has had difficulty making individual or collective progress on her debt.

	 In evaluating Guideline F cases, the concept of "'meaningful track record' necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts." An applicant is not required to establish that he has paid off each debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant's financial situation and actions in evaluating applicant's plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. A reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. Favorable decision affirmed.

	 In 2005, after a nasty argument with his then wife, the police arrested and charged Applicant with multiple criminal acts after finding a marijuana plant and four properly owned guns in his basement. The State decided to proceed forward on three criminal counts: marijuana cultivation, special offender, and false imprisonment. Applicant and his attorney negotiated a plea agreement with the State. In early 2006, upon the advice of his attorney, Applicant pled guilty to marijuana cultivation, a felony, and entered a temporary plea of guilty. The court deferred judgment in his case for two years. At the end of the two years and because Applicant had not been arrested by the police for any criminal conduct or even traffic offense, the court withdrew his guilty plea and dismissed the case, as required by the plea agreement, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns under Guideline J, but not Guideline H. Guideline J is found in favor of Applicant and Guideline H is found against Applicant.

Since coming to the United States, she has returned to China only twice, in 2001 and 2007. Applicant has mitigated security concerns based on nature of the relationship with her family members in the PRC. She established her loyalty and obligation to the United States and her lack of loyalty and obligation to the PRC, so that she is not subject to foreign pressure or coercion and can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States.

	 Security concerns raised due to Applicant's use of marijuana on two occasions, once in 2003 and once in February 2007, are mitigated due to Applicant's written and express intent not to use illegal drugs in the future and his acknowledgment that any future illegal drug use will result in the automatic revocation of his security clearance. Applicant's illegal drug use was experimental and sporadic. His deliberate omission of his February 2007 marijuana use on a security questionnaire signed in April 2007 is mitigated by his full disclosure of his marijuana use on subsequent security questionnaire filled out in July 2007. The drug involvement and personal conduct concerns have been mitigated. Clearance is granted.
