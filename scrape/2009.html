	 Applicant used marijuana from February 2000 to February 2009. His failure to list the full extent of his marijuana use on his Security Clearance Application was not deliberate. During his security interview, Applicant stated that he might use marijuana in the future. He used marijuana after he was granted a security clearance in January 2009. Currently, he does not use marijuana. Although he states that he will remain drug- free, this statement conflicts with his earlier statement that he might use it in the future. His recent statement of intent does not outweigh his long-term, illegal drug use, and his use while holding a security clearance. Clearance is denied.

	 Applicant's unexpected discovery his wife was having an affair in the spring of 2002 triggered his depression. After his divorce in January 2003, Applicant's child support obligations were difficult to meet because of his employment problems. He also had difficulties addressing four past due accounts listed in the SOR as they became delinquent in 2004. He also acknowledged tax problems for 2002 and 2005, which are still not resolved. The credit reports show Applicant still owes the four listed creditors. Though he has paid $545 on the SOR 1.a. account in February 2009, he has failed to make any remaining payments under the settlement plan. The only other delinquent debt Applicant satisfied was a $65 account to an unlisted creditor in March 2009. Applicant's evidence in mitigation does not meet his burden of persuasion under the financial considerations guideline. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.

	 Applicant and her husband started a mortgage business just before the national crisis in that industry. The business failed, and they accumulated significant credit card debt since 2008 in an effort to pay their living expenses. In addition, Applicant's husband suffered a back injury in a car accident and he was unable to work for several months. Applicant's efforts to meet her obligations demonstrate reliability and a mature response to events beyond her control. She quickly obtained a job with a steady salary and medical benefits; then secured another, higher paying position; and she negotiated a mortgage modification that significantly reduced her payments. She retained an attorney who is about to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition to resolve her outstanding debts. Applicant's debts stem from efforts to pay for standard living expenses and her husband's medical expenses, and are unrelated to drug or alcohol abuse, gambling, or frivolous spending. Her trustworthiness is not at issue. Clearance is granted.

	 The Statement of Reasons alleges two delinquent debts amounting to approximately $17,600. Applicant has long disputed owing either debt. However, he is liable for the first because he co-signed the credit card application, making him jointly liable for it. On the second, he owes a deficiency judgment on a motorcycle he did not use. He disputes the high deficiency balance, saying it stems from the creditor's irresponsibly depreciating the vehicle, through no fault of Applicant's. He expects the credit card debt to be resolved through garnishment, but has taken no action to inform the parties as to his current employer or his current address. He now states he is willing to pay the motorcycle deficiency and will take action in the future, but such statements are insufficient to qualify as good-faith efforts to resolve debts. Applicant's denial of responsibility for legitimate debts, and his lack of effort to resolve them, raises questions about his trustworthiness and good judgment. Clearance is denied.

He failed to list his present employer on a security clearance application because he did not want a prospective employer to know he was working for a competitor. Applicant successfully mitigated the security concerns raised under Guideline E, Personal Conduct. Clearance is granted.

	 The Statement of Reasons alleges delinquent debts amounting to more than $600,000, which started accruing in 2007. Applicant divorced in 2005, and engaged in a three-year series of legal battles about custody and child support. He was required to pay alimony, child support, and his family's living expenses. He could not sell his home to pay his debts because of the collapse of the housing market. His home was foreclosed but later sold for more than he owed on his mortgage. Although he does not owe the balance of his mortgage, his current outstanding debt remains at more than $90,000. Applicant provided evidence that he paid one debt and is paying on two others. However, he has not contacted the remaining creditors, or made an effort to establish payment plans to resolve these substantial delinquencies.

	 Applicant stopped paying on a credit card debt in 2006 when finances became tight because of unexpected legal and counseling costs for his younger son. He is saving funds and plans to resolve the $6,378 balance as soon as he can determine who is presently entitled to collect it. Another creditor is not holding him legally responsible for his spouse's $5,326 delinquent credit card balance, although the funds to repay it will come out of their household income. These unresolved debts are not likely to cause Applicant to engage in illegal activity. Clearance is granted.

	 Foreign Influence and Information Technology concerns were mitigated in a previous decision, dated March 24, 2009. In that decision, Foreign Preference concerns were not mitigated because Applicant possessed a valid Israeli passport at the close of the record. Upon receiving the adverse decision, Applicant claimed he misunderstood the procedures for mitigating the security concern with regard to his possession of valid foreign passport. The Appeal Board remanded the case to me based on additional evidence Applicant submitted. I do not find Applicant's explanation credible. Regardless, even if he had timely surrendered his valid foreign passport to his security office, it cannot be considered an unconditional surrender because he indicated on several occasions during his background investigation that he may need to ask for his passport back when he travels to Israel in the future.

Prior to the hearing, he received written guidance from DOHA that he had the right to employ counsel, or have another person represent him; that he had the right to present evidence and witnesses; that he had the right to cross-examine witnesses against him; and that he had the right to object to evidence. At the hearing, the Judge told him of his right to employ counsel. He said he decided to represent himself. He presented documentary evidence, called witnesses, and testified in his own behalf. He points to nothing which he would have done differently had he had counsel, or anything likely to have produced a different result.

	 A person who bears arms for a country demonstrates a willingness to risk life and limb for that country which is strong evidence of a profound commitment to the interests of that country. A willingness to bear arms for a foreign country raises serious security concerns about an applicant seeking access to classified information. These concerns apply here, where, after moving abroad, Applicant voluntarily served in the armed forces of a foreign country for almost ten years, obtained foreign citizenship in order to facilitate his entry into the armed forces, held a foreign security clearance, held an intelligence-related position in the foreign military, accepted the foreign military's largesse to obtain a graduate degree, and anticipates the receipt of a benefit as a result of his foreign military service. Applicant's eventual return to the U.S. and his eventual (after the passage of significant additional time) renunciation of foreign citizenship and surrender of his foreign passport are insufficient to vitiate the concerns raised by the voluntary choices he made.

	 From about March 2006 to February 2007, Applicant continued to accept public assistance knowing she was ineligible. She owes about $50,000 in delinquent debt that she has little prospect of resolving in the foreseeable future. Her failure to fully disclose her indebtedness on her security clearance application was due to misunderstanding and neglect of her financial obligations rather than to an intent to conceal. Financial and personal conduct concerns persist because of her financial irresponsibility and poor judgment in accepting welfare benefits when she was ineligible. Clearance is denied.

	 Applicant's two arrests for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol in November 2006 and February 2008 raised security concerns under alcohol consumption and criminal conduct. A May 2008 citation for driving while his license was suspended raised further concerns under criminal conduct. Applicant mitigated security concerns based on his volunteering to attend an alcohol program prior to his court sentence. He was never formally diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. His increased level of alcohol use was a coping mechanism resulting from his 2006 divorce. There is no evidence his alcohol use interfered with his work. His outstanding 30-year military career and his outstanding 20-year career as a DoD contractor support the premise that Applicant's actions were a departure from his normal pattern of behavior. Applicant mitigated the security concerns raised under alcohol consumption and personal conduct. Clearance is granted.

He has subsequently established a "meaningful track record" of debt payments by actually paying off some of his delinquent SOR debts, setting up payment arrangements with others, and setting up his personal plan to avoid future financial difficulties.

When he learned that this presented an issue, he surrendered his passport to his security officer. The elimination of this security risk, and his strong ties to the United States, have allayed the governments security concerns under Guidelines B and C. Clearance is granted.

	 The Judge's description of Item 7 of the File of Relevant Material (FORM) is ambiguous and may be in error and the error may well have affected his evaluation of the case. The financial statement shows that Applicant, after paying her monthly expenses (but prior to paying down her debts) actually has a monthly remainder of $536.10 (not $263, as the Judge found). According to the financial statement she then uses one half of that ($263) to pay down her debts and is left with a net remainder of $263.10. Additionally, the Judge correctly notes the lack of corroboration for Applicant's statements regarding her payments on her debts. The FORM, at Section VII, contains language which may not reasonably have advised Applicant of the nature of her opportunity to submit evidence (e.g., documents which would corroborate her claims) under the Directive.

	 Applicant's delinquent debts started accruing during her marriage. Because both she and her husband were students, and were only sporadically employed, she was unable to meet expenses related to college, children, and medical issues. After her husband became abusive, Applicant left him, and was required to support herself and three children on one income. She was unable to pay her debts during the first one-and-a-half years after the separation. However, after her husband responded to a court order and began paying child support, she immediately addressed her debts. She has paid all but one debt, and has an up-to-date payment plan in place on that obligation. Applicant's conduct demonstrates trustworthiness, and has allayed the government's security concerns under Guideline F. No derogatory information was presented on the personal conduct allegation.

	 Sixty-two-year-old Applicant, holding a security clearance since 1967, was confronted with the usual lifestyle choices and expenses. He attempted to balance the needs of family and business with those of timely payment of creditors, and he was, at least for a time, unsuccessful. He has subsequently established a "meaningful track record" of debt payments by actually paying off most of his delinquent SOR debts, setting up arrangements with, and making the first payment, to the one remaining creditor, and setting up his personal plan to avoid future financial difficulties. He is owed approximately $280,000 in back wages and reimbursable expenses, which he expects to start drawing in April.

	 The Judge found that Applicant has four siblings and one half sibling living in Iran. Applicant has traveled to Iran on several occasions over the last two decades. Applicant used an Iranian passport for those trips to Iran (now expired and relinquished to his security officer). Department Counsel persuasively argues that the Judge's favorable decision was made without sufficient attention to contrary record evidence. The obscurity of foreign relatives or the failure of foreign authorities to contact those relatives do not reliably measure the security risk attendant to their presence when they are subject to a hostile regime with a dismal human rights record. Favorable decision reversed.

	 Applicant mitigated security concerns arising from delinquent debts. The debts arose over a period of several years after expensive spinal surgeries in 2000 and 2001 that resulted in several months of unemployment. She has almost paid one of the three largest debts, cleared a second one for delinquent auto loan payments, and is negotiating the third one. The remaining debts of approximately $3,000 are mostly for family medical expenses. She has been unable to do more because of limited income and family responsibilities since she provides the only income for the family of six. Recently, she received a promotion and took steps to reduce expenses so she can now resolve the remaining debts. She has worked for the same company for 15 years holding a security clearance for 12 years. She is highly regarded by her employer. Clearance is granted.

	 The Judge based his ultimate holding upon the extent to which Applicant's conduct with a particular woman (W) evidences poor judgment or subjects him to the possibility of duress, rather than simply upon the nature of the relationship itself. The Board finds no reason to disturb the Judge's conclusion that the record as a whole in Applicant's case raises Guideline E security concerns. Hearing Office decisions are binding neither on other Hearing Office Judges nor on the Board. The Judge articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made. The Judge explicitly considered Applicant's stellar 40-year career. However, he reasonably explained why Applicant's recent conduct with W weighs more heavily than his prior good record. The Judge's conclusion that Applicant had failed to meet his burden of persuasion as to mitigation, either under the pertinent mitigating conditions or the whole-person factors, is sustainable on this record. After the Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. Adverse decision affirmed.

	 Applicant maintains that there is not substantial evidence of Guideline J security concerns on the specific issue of whether the government proved the fourth element of the crime of "harboring" under 8 U.S.C. 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) Applicant argues that the fourth element requires proof that Applicant's conduct tended to substantially facilitate the alien (his wife and stepdaughter) remaining in the United States illegally. He argues that the record does not satisfy the element since: Applicant consulted an attorney (about his wife's and stepdaughter's situation); who then filed pertinent forms on behalf of them with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency and Applicant openly attempted to obtain legal status for his wife, and in so doing he discussed it with the INS and his security officer. These actions exposed his wife's location and status to the INS, the DOD and the OPM. He argues that the phrase "substantially facilitate" means to make an alien's presence in the United States substantially easier or less difficult and is tied to actions aimed at preventing the detection and apprehension of aliens. Applicant's arguments have merit as to Guideline J, however, the Judge's Guideline E analysis is affirmed. Adverse decision affirmed

	 Applicant argues that the Judge erred in admitting three Government documents in absence of evidence that Applicant had actually seen them in preparing her form. Under the facts of this case these documents have no probative value, without evidence linking them to Applicant. Department Counsel's descriptions of them to the Judge constitute at most offers of proof, which have no evidentiary value. These documents were inadmissible. Once admitted, it was error for the Judge to have considered them on the substantive questions arising from Applicant's answer to the SCA. The Judge found against Applicant under both Guidelines E and J. The Judge's language demonstrates that, in interpreting the intent underlying Applicant's answer to the SCA, the Judge relied heavily on the three inadmissable documents. Therefore, the Board cannot say with a reasonable degree of certainty that, had she not considered these documents, she would nevertheless have arrived at the same decision.

	 Applicant viewed adult and child pornography while in college. When he started work after college, he continued his practice, using his work computer. He accessed pornography from approximately 1990 to 2005. His wife, supervisor, co-workers and friends were unaware of his habit. He viewed pornography because he enjoyed doing something taboo. In 2005, a polygraph disclosed his habit. He realized the gravity of his conduct, confessed to his wife, and installed content-monitoring software on his work computer. Almost two years later, he began counseling with his pastor. Currently, no one other than his wife and pastor know of his behavior and he does not wish others to find out. Applicant is vulnerable to coercion. In addition, he disabled the content-monitoring software, and again viewed pornography in 2008, approximately 6 months before the hearing. Applicant's criminal conduct, his long use of pornography, his desire to circumvent rules, and his concealment of his actions demonstrate untrustworthiness and unwillingness to follow rules.

During his security clearance interview, he learned that there was a criminal court record related to these checks and that he had unpaid debts. Because he did not recognize the debts, he filed an identity theft notice with the police and the credit reporting companies, challenging the validity of the debts. His challenges to the debts resulted in the removal of the debts from his credit reports. The fraud alert remains on his credit reports. He pays his bills in a timely manner.

In fact, what he characterized as merely helping friends, was seemingly much more than that, for he admitted the existence of a financial scheme to initially take out the mortgage for at least one of his friends with an anticipated quitclaim deed to be issued for a $10,000 payment. Considering the circumstances of the loans, his actions, if not actually frivolous, were definitely irresponsible. Both friends failed to make their monthly mortgage payments, and one mortgage delinquency was charged off to profit and loss and the other one is simply very delinquent. Since he did not reside in either house, he had no interest in the loan status. He acknowledges that he is legally responsible for the debts, but has no intention of paying either mortgage, and has made no effort to go after the beneficiaries.

	 Forty-one-year-old Applicant qualified for a series of home mortgages, each time refinancing to attain lower monthly payments. In January 2007, she refinanced again, and based on her credit application, was qualified and granted a $360,000 1st mortgage and a $67,000 2nd mortgage. The new provisions were to be identical to the earlier provisions, but the mortgage lender made an error. When corrected, her monthly payment increased from nearly $1,518 to nearly $3,076. Unable to pay the increased payments, even by using funds from her retirement account, she unsuccessfully sought assistance. The mortgage lender advised her to either sell the property at a pre- foreclosure or short sale of let it go into foreclosure. She abandoned the property. Both mortgage lenders have commenced the foreclosure process. Applicant has reduced her monthly expenses and has no other delinquencies. Considering the current global economic situation, the circumstances behind the mortgage loans given to her, and her efforts to resolve the issue, the simple fact of foreclosure, in this instance, does not indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. Questions and doubts as to her security eligibility and suitability have been satisfied. Clearance is granted.

	 Forty-two-year-old Applicant, required to pay child support for two children, did so for about four years. Because of continuing disputes with his ex-spouse over visitation denials and the way she was spending the child support, and unable to resolve their differences, Applicant unilaterally stopped all such payments for about five or six years before resuming them. The children resided with him from six months to three years at various times, but Applicant initially continued to pay child support. At no time while his children were residing with him, did Applicant ever petition the court or ask his ex-spouse to either suspend his child support payments to her or for her to provide him with child support. While he was serving overseas, Applicant's wages were garnished, and in July 2008, the state filed a collection action against him for child support arrearage in the amount of $30,718. An Order was entered reducing the child support arrearage to $18,000, plus costs, to be paid no later than March 27, 2009, and the matter will be considered closed.

	 Applicant contends on appeal that the Judge erred in concluding that the evidence sets forth Guideline E security concerns, in that the evidence does not demonstrate that her omissions were deliberate. In evaluating an applicant's state of mind, the Judge must examine the omissions or false statements in light of the entirety of the record evidence. The Judge took into account the fact that the questions at issue "are neither difficult, confusing or misleading." She also considered Applicant's various explanations for the omissions, concluding that "none of her explanations for failing to answer the questions accurately are reasonable or even comprehensible." . The Board concludes that the Judge's finding that Applicant's omissions were deliberate is supported by substantial record evidence. An applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

	 Applicant was born and raised in Cuba. As a young man, he served time in jail for his political beliefs. He and his family immigrated to the United States (U.S.) in 1980 when the Cuban government allowed political prisoners to leave Cuba. He and his wife divorced in 1991. His former wife and three children live in the U.S. Applicant's daughter is a U.S. citizen. He remarried in 1996 and became a citizen of the U.S. in the same year. His present wife is a permanent resident of the U.S., but a citizen of Columbia. Except for her daughter, her family members are residents and citizens of Columbia. After the U.S. eased travel restrictions to Cuba in 1999, Applicant obtained a Cuban passport, which he used to enter Cuba when he visited his parents in 2000 and 2002. His Cuban passport has expired. He will not renew it as he does not intend to travel to Cuba in the future. He traveled to Columbia once to meet his wife's family. He considers himself an American citizen, not a Cuban citizen. He has demonstrated that he has no loyalties to Cuba and that there is no heightened risk because of his family in Cuba and his wife's family in Columbia. He has mitigated the government's security concerns under Guidelines B and C. He did not intentionally falsify his security clearance application. Thus, there is no security concern under Guideline E. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.

	 Forty-eight-year-old Applicant had 13 SOR-identified purportedly continuing delinquencies, most of which have been satisfied or otherwise resolved; and some were apparently not her responsibility. A single mother of three children, whose ex-spouse was over $30,000.00 in arrears on child support payments, experienced financial difficulties which resulted in accounts becoming delinquent and being "charged off" and/or placed for collection, and a house foreclosure. With a solid employment record, she was eventually able to focus on her debts and has paid off all but two. She generally has a monthly balance of about $1,122 in discretionary funds available for her use to resolve her remaining delinquent debts, and intends to pay off those debts as well. She has written both creditors but they have not responded. Her actions in addressing her debts indicate good-faith efforts on her part, and show clear indications any such problem is now largely under control. Questions and doubts as to her security eligibility and suitability have been satisfied. Clearance is granted.

Thus, the Judge's credibility determination is not entitled to the same deference on appeal that it would receive in the context of a hearing. Applicant had two prior felony convictions for perjury and multiple convictions relating to larceny by check. The Judge did not give sufficient weight to the extent to which those crimes of moral turpitude undermined Applicant's credibility and his assertions that his failure to disclose multiple matters of obvious security concern was not deliberate. As to Applicant's falsifications, the Judge failed consider an important aspect of the case, failed to articulate a satisfactory explanation for her favorable conclusion, and offered an explanation that ran contrary to the record evidence as a whole. The Smith Amendment-related provision set forth at Guideline J AG  32(e) does not apply in Applicant's case. However, because of the Board's holding as to Applicant's deliberate falsification of his SCA, as set forth above, the Judge's overall adverse decision under Guideline J is sustainable on independent, alternative grounds. The government was only responsible for presenting evidence to establish the facts alleged in the SOR that had been controverted.

	 Applicant engaged in criminal conduct in 1990 by forging a credit card-holder's name, and was sentenced to 2 years probation. While on probation, he was involved in theft of personal property. Also while on probation, he committed computer fraud and grand theft by illegally transferring funds from bank accounts. He was convicted and served two years in prison. While in prison, he was convicted of receiving stolen goods. Although he has not been involved in similar criminal conduct since the mid-1990s, he has received a series of civil citations from 1996 through 2008. His persistent and recent disregard of regulations continues the pattern of unwillingness or inability to conform to the law that he displayed in the past. He has failed to allay the government's security concerns under Guidelines J and E. Clearance is denied.
