	 Applicant's financial problems over the last 11 years have been very serious. The record reflects that on repeated occasions, her efforts to repay her debts on a regular basis have been stymied by a variety of problems. Her child support problems still plague her today. The father of her oldest child was imprisoned for three months for failure to pay child support, and still is more than $5,000.00 in arrears. In 1999, her mother became ill and Applicant has had to provide considerable monetary support for her since then. Applicant had taken several good-faith steps to pay some of the listed creditors in early 2006 when her mother died in April 2006. By the totality of the evidence, Applicant mitigates the security concerns raised by the financial guideline.

	 Personal conduct, criminal conduct, and drug involvement concerns were raised pertaining to Applicant's failure to list three marijuana possession charges which occurred in the early 1990s. In May 2001, he was terminated for refusal to submit to a random urinalysis test. I find credible his explanation that his failure to take the random urinalysis test was the result of receiving an emergency phone call from his wife indicating that his son was in a serious accident. His failure to list his three drug-related charges from the early 1990s was not deliberate. He misunderstood the question and thought he only had to go back seven years. He has not used illegal drugs in over 13 years. Applicant mitigated the security concerns raised under Guidelines E, J, and G. Clearance is granted.

After being interviewed by a security investigator in March 2005, she resolved or successfully disputed four debts. In June 2006, she paid off two debts with a loan from her credit union. She claimed to have paid or resolved four other debts, but she presented no documentary evidence to support her claim. She has not mitigated the security concern based on financial considerations. Clearance is denied.

	 Applicant was convicted of speeding and driving under the influence (DUI) in May 1994. In April 2002, he pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance after his female companion, who was driving his truck, had an accident and cocaine was found in her purse. In May 2003, he pleaded guilty to reckless driving after he damaged his truck while driving in a mud field. He failed to disclose an unpaid judgment on his security clearance application (SF 86), but produced evidence at the hearing that he was unaware of the judgment when he executed his SF 86. He refuted the allegation of falsifying his SF 86 and mitigated the security concern based on criminal conduct. Clearance is granted.

	 Applicant's criminal conduct culminated in April 1998 when he pleaded guilty to three felony offenses: (1) malicious wounding; (2) attempted malicious wounding; and (3) failure to appear on a felony charge. As a result, he served about 13 months in confinement. He completed supervised probation in December 2000, and he is required to be of good behavior until April 27, 2008. There is ample evidence of successful rehabilitation, to include passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, extensive job training, a good employment record, and a stable personal life. But due to serving more than one year in prison, he is disqualified from having a security clearance granted or renewed by the Defense Department under 10 U.S.C. § 986(c)(1). In other words, this case is decided against Applicant based solely on 10 U.S.C. § 986. Clearance is denied.

	 The Applicant received inpatient treatment in 1991, and was diagnosed as suffering from "alcohol dependence." Despite this diagnosis, the Applicant consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication, as evidenced by five subsequent alcohol related arrests. He has not consumed the intoxicant since completing inpatient treatment in 2004. However, there is no evidence of a "favorable prognosis," as required by the last mitigating condition. Furthermore, his past criminal conduct is fairly recent, in light of his 16 arrests spanning a period from 1982~2004. He was also less than candid when he executed his March 2004 Security Clearance Application (SCA). In November of 2004, when given an opportunity to clarify his answers to his SCA, the Applicant refused to cooperate. Mitigation is not shown. Clearance is denied.

	 Applicant was convicted of a 1992 felony assault with a motor vehicle while intoxicated following an accident in which his young daughter was left a quadriplegic. After five years of abstinence, he resumed drinking and was arrested for drunk driving in May 1999. Alcohol consumption concerns and alcohol-related criminal conduct concerns are mitigated by the absence of any abusive drinking since 1999 and abstinence since March 2004. Financial considerations raised by three bad debts are mitigated since he has satisfied one of the debts and is not incurring new delinquent debt. Personal conduct concerns exist because he falsely denied any alcohol-related offenses when he completed his security clearance application in August 2001. Clearance is denied.

	 Applicant is a 23-year-old health insurance claims processor who has worked for the same defense contractor since 2004. While a teenager, he was dared into stealing beer from a store. The police escorted him home and he was fined $100. He failed to include this incident on a 2004 questionnaire because he was not formally arrested and he did not consider the incident to be a charge or conviction. In early 2005, he pled guilty to the charge of Operating a Motor Vehicle While Intoxicated. After a night in jail, he was "scared straight" and is committed to never drinking and driving or being in such a position again. Applicant has shown that his conduct does not pose an unacceptable risk. Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is granted.

	 While Applicant's criminal conduct and his personal conduct in omitting material information from his security form raised serious security concerns, Applicant has rebutted these concerns. He established that there were medical reasons for his failure to reveal all of his criminal arrests and convictions on his security form and that he had no intent to falsify. Further, there is no evidence that he was involved with any criminal activity since 1990. This subsequent clean record establishes his rehabilitation and mitigates the 1970, 1974, 1980, 1981, and 1990 incidents. While after the 1974 charge and conviction, he was sentenced to serve four years, there is no evidence in the record that in fact he actually served more than one year. Thus, the 1974 criminal conviction and incarceration do not fall within 10 U.S.C. Section 986, as amended. Clearance is granted.

Although he no longer drives after drinking, he continues to consume alcohol to excess on occasion when out socially. He was not candid about his arrests or financial record on his security clearance application, and did not timely return workmen's compensation benefits to which he was not entitled.

	 On June 17, 2004, Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. In November 2004, the case was dismissed. No debts were discharged. Applicant has approximately $12,814 in delinquent consumer debt. He has resolved two of these accounts. A chronic medical condition prevented him from working full-time in 2003. At hearing, Applicant disclosed that he and his wife owe the IRS approximately $23,000 for tax years 2000 - 2003. They recently entered into a repayment plan. Although he has resolved some of his delinquent accounts, the majority of his debts remain unresolved. His plan to resolve these accounts is too speculative to mitigate the security concern under Guideline F. Aside from a minor incident in 2004, the majority of his criminal offenses occurred over nine years ago. Guideline J is concluded for Applicant. However, a security concern remains under Guideline F. Clearance is denied.

	 Applicant's financial problems arose from circumstances largely beyond his control, including unexpected unemployment, the need to relocate, and medical problems limiting his wife's ability to work. After moving to get his present job, he was unable to sell his former home or to make the mortgage payments, resulting in foreclosure and remaining debt. Under these circumstances, the delinquencies do not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Considering Applicant's character, I find he is not vulnerable to pressure to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his history of failing to meet his financial obligations and inability to satisfy his debts. Clearance is granted.

	 The Applicant's financial difficulties were caused by circumstances largely beyond his control, unemployment or underemployment for more than five years. He has now addressed all of his admitted past due debts, and has a positive monthly cash flow of about $2,000. His last alcohol related arrest was nearly ten years ago; and as such, his past alcohol abuse is not of current security significance. More problematic, however, is his Personal Conduct and related Criminal Conduct. The Applicant was less than candid with the Government when he executed his May 2003 Security Clearance Application (SCA). This wilful falsification is a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001.

	 Applicant repeatedly used and purchased various illegal drugs from October 2002 to November 2003.

However, in the absence of a longer period of confirmed current continuing abstinence and in light of his past conduct, his recent vow to abstain, does not constitute a "demonstrated intent" not to abuse any drugs in the future.

The Judge failed to analyze specifically the investigation conducted by the Russian Security Service of Applicant and his Russian girlfreind.

In about 2000, Applicant violated company policy by failing to pay his corporate credit card account when due, but that was an isolated event several years ago. Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial difficulties and personal conduct. Clearance is granted.

	 Applicant encountered financial problems after separating from active duty military service. She incurred approximately $16,000 in delinquent debt. In 2000, she entered into a repayment plan but was unable to complete the plan as a result of having to take unpaid leave due to a difficult pregnancy. She has paid off some medical bills but the majority of the delinquent debt remains unresolved. Since mid 2002, she has not contacted any of the creditors to resolve the debts. She has not made a good faith effort to resolve these debts. Her failure to list her delinquent debt on her security clearance application was not deliberate. The personal conduct concern is mitigated. However, she failed to mitigate the security concern arising from her financial situation. Clearance is denied.

	 Applicant seeks a security clearance as a requirement for his position as a security officer for a defense contractor. In 1996, Applicant was terminated as a corrections officer for violating his department's sexual harassment policy and related misconduct on the job. In 2001, he resigned from his position as chief security officer from a cruise ship lines following allegations of sexual harassment. Further, at the time of the alleged misconduct on the cruise ship lines, he was married and he did not want his wife to find out what had happened. This raised personal conduct and sexual behavior concerns. Applicant has mitigated these concerns as a result of significant life style changes and also by having informed his wife of his past.

	 This 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor was born in Iran in 1970. He came to the U.S. in 1992. His mother, father, a sister, and a brother, all of whom now reside in the U.S. are dual citizens of the U.S. and Iran. He has two other siblings who live in and are citizens of Iran. From 1989 to 1991, he served in the Iranian military. During that military service, he was incarcerated by Iranian authorities because his immediate family members were living in the U.S. He traveled to Iran in 1999, and although he was a U.S. citizen and had a U.S. passport, he used his Iranian passport to enter Iran. That passport has expired, but can still be used to enter Iran. Applicant still considers himself to be a dual U.S./Iranian citizen. Mitigation has not been established. Clearance is denied.

	 Applicant is a mature individual with a long record of excellent service working for a defense contractor. His financial difficulties arose in part from mismanagement of his finances and in part from circumstances beyond his control. Rather than declaring bankruptcy, Applicant chose to repay his delinquent debts over time. Ultimately, Applicant paid, settled, or arranged a payment plan for all the debts listed in the SOR. I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial difficulties. Clearance is granted.

Since then, he has remained drug-free and has excelled at his job. Although Applicant shows promise, at this time he has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his long history of drug involvement. Clearance is denied.

While she has now demonstrated she has made a good-faith effort to resolve several of her long-standing debts, even more debts remain outstanding.

	 Applicant is 65 years old and has held a top secret security clearance for 37 years while working for a federal contractor. Applicant handled classified material on a daily basis during his career. During a four-month period he had two security violations, one inadvertent, and the other involved a difference in professional opinions on the classification of the project. Applicant acknowledged he should have been proactive on the issue when the classification could not be resolved immediately. Neither violation involved a compromise of classified information. Applicant has renewed his commitment to his security responsibilities and has taken affirmative steps in seeking expert advice on security issues. He has successfully mitigated security concerns regarding Guideline K, security violations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. Clearance is granted.

	 Applicant has a history of financial problems from about 1995, when he was recalled to work after a layoff at less than half his previous salary. He incurred unforeseen costs after a fire in his home in 1996 forced him and his family (spouse and nine children) into a hotel and then apartment for almost a year. Chapter 13 bankruptcies filed in November 1996 and September 1998 were dismissed before his debts were repaid. Under a Chapter 13 filed in December 1998, Applicant made some payments of $700 monthly, but was four months in arrears as of January 2001. He resolved his secured debts through a September 2002 refinancing, but again fell behind. A November 2003 judgment of $1,024 for water/sewer services was unpaid as of July 2005. Financial considerations persist. Personal conduct and criminal conduct concerns are raised by his failure to disclose larceny charges on his SF 86. Clearance is denied.

Applicant's financial problems resumed in 2000 when he mistakenly believed he could increase his credit and use his credit cards responsibly.

	 Applicant's finances were in disarray since about 2001, when he started an ill-fated part-time business for which he used his credit cards. His balances became overwhelming and increasingly delinquent. With the assistance of a credit counseling service and an attorney, he set up a budget and attempted to make timely payments to some creditors. By May 2004, his monthly expenses left him with a net monthly deficit of over $800.00. In July 2005, his liabilities, totaling nearly $25,000.00, were discharged in bankruptcy. Applicant's actions in obtaining credit counseling as well as his continuing efforts to resolve all past outstanding financial obligations, while constrained by available income, have successfully mitigated or overcome the government's case.

Although Article 15 nonjudicial punishment is imposed under the Uniform Code of Military Justice administratively and not as a result of a court-martial, the manner in which an Article 15 is imposed does not preclude a Judge from finding that imposition of Article 15 nonjudicial punishment is evidence that an applicant's conduct constitutes criminal conduct under Guideline J.

	 The provisions of the Directive (including the Adjudicative Guidelines) must be interpreted and construed in a manner that is consistent with the national security objectives of the industrial security program. Moreover, each of the Guidelines in the Adjudicative Guidelines should be interpreted and construed in light of its wording considered in its entirety, not just one portion or the other of that language. Just because Applicant's case does not involve worse conduct and circumstances, it does not follow that the Administrative Judge could not conclude Applicant's conduct and financial circumstances raise security concerns under Guideline F.

	 Because there is no presumption of error below, the Administrative Judge's unchallenged findings of fact stand, and need not be reviewed by the Board. The federal government is not required to wait until an applicant commits a security violation before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Moreover, the federal government is not limited to evaluating an applicant's security eligibility in terms of the applicant's job performance or on-duty conduct. An applicant's off-duty conduct can be considered when it has a rational bearing on evaluating the applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.

	 When an applicant controverts a falsification allegation, the Administrative Judge must consider whether there is record evidence, direct or circumstantial, that is probative of an applicant's intent or state of mind at the time of the alleged falsification. An applicant's statements about his or intent or state of mind are relevant and material evidence, but such statements are not conclusive or binding on a Judge. In this case, there is sufficient record evidence to permit the Judge to find that Applicant's omission about his past marijuana use was a deliberate falsification.

	 The Applicant and her ex-spouse filed for the protection of bankruptcy in March of 1997. The bankruptcy was due to the failure of her husband's family's grocery store. Federal tax liens for tax years 1992~1995 have been filed against the Applicant and her ex-spouse. She thought her ex-spouse had filed these tax returns, returns she had signed; but he did not file them. The Applicant's ex-spouse admits his culpability, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) views her as an "Innocent Spouse." As a result, the IRS only requires her to pay $25 each month towards tax liens totaling in excess of $83,000. When the Applicant executed her 2003 Security Clearance Application (SCA), she answered "No" to question 36. She thought the tax liens were filed more than seven years prior.

	 Applicant, with an otherwise unblemished record of protecting and safeguarding classified information, committed a deliberate security violation by downloading unclassified files from his facility's classified computer onto his pocket computer, which he took home without first checking for classified information. While subsequent investigations by his facility failed to find any classified information in the transferred files, Applicant's actions were deliberate and express security violations. His actions are isolated, though, and successfully mitigated by demonstrated overall judgment and reliability in handling classified systems and information.

	 Although Applicant's ties to Sudan through his in-laws raise a foreign influence security concern, Applicant has successfully mitigated this concern. Until Applicant's interim secret security clearance was suspended as a result of these proceedings, he had been serving as an Arabic linguist accompanying U.S. Forces in Iraq. He personally participated in the identification and capture of a prominent official associated with the former Iraqi regime. Based on the totality of the circumstances, Applicant's ties to his in-laws do not pose an unacceptable risk or concern of foreign influence. Clearance is granted.

	 The Applicant, a retired Army Colonel, has addressed all of the alleged past due debts. The Applicant made an honest "mistake" in not listing his past due debts in answer to question 38 on his May 2000 Security Clearance Application (SCA). The Government, however, already knew of the Applicant's past due debts as they were the subject of a May 1999 Letter of Intent (LOI). In answer to question 32 on his SCA, the Applicant did not divulge that his clearance had been revoked as a result of the LOI. Although the Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR attached to the LOI, he was unaware the Letter of Intent had actually revoked/suspended his clearance. His veracity is corroborated by three high ranking witnesses. Mitigation is shown. Clearance is granted.
