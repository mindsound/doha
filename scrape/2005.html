There are at least three outstanding warrants for her arrest for nonpayment of the charges related to three bad checks. Court costs related to each charge were imposed as well as fines. Applicant attributes her financial predicament to being unemployed as well as living beyond her means when she was employed. She has no intention to pay off a number of the debts, because she believes the debts will drop off her credit report in the next couple of years. Although she has defaulted on payment of a number of her debts, she vacationed in Mexico on at least nine occasions while her debts went unpaid. Clearly, her priority is not to get her finances in order. Clearance is denied.

	 Because there is no presumption of error below, the Administrative Judge's unchallenged findings of fact do not have to be reviewed by the Board. The Judge's finding that Applicant served in the military reserves is a plausible interpretation of the record evidence in this case. Board cannot consider the new evidence proffered by Applicant on appeal. Given the absence of any response to the File of Relevant Material from Applicant, the Judge properly made her findings of fact and reached her conclusions based on the File of Relevant Material. Adverse decision affirmed.

	 By asking the Board to substitute its judgment for that of the Administrative Judge, Applicant is asking for relief to which he is not entitled. The Board's scope of review is limited under the terms of the Directive. Applicant's ability to argue for a plausible, alternate interpretation of the record evidence does not demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, nor does it demonstrate the Judge erred with respect to Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1. A favorable credibility determination does not preclude an unfavorable decision based on security concerns unrelated to an applicant's candor and honesty. Adverse decision affirmed.

	 Given the Administrative Judge's unchallenged findings about Applicant's family ties and financial interests in Lebanon, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to conclude security concerns were raised under Guideline B that shifted the burden of persuasion to Applicant. Applicant's disagreements with the Judge's weighing of the record evidence are not sufficient to demonstrate error by the Judge. Adverse decision affirmed.

	 There is a rebuttable presumption that quasi-judicial officials are unbiased and impartial, and a party seeking to rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal. Bias or lack of impartiality is not demonstrated merely because an Administrative Judge made adverse findings of reached unfavorable conclusions in a case. Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge was unbiased and impartial. The Judge's findings and conclusions about Applicant's history of financial difficulties are sustainable. Given the record evidence in this case, it is not clear whether the Judge's findings of falsification are sustainable, but remand is not warranted because any error concerning those findings would be harmless in light of the Judge's sustainable findings and conclusions under Guideline F.

	 Department Counsel's ability to make a strong argument for an alternate interpretation of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Administrative Judge weighed the evidence improperly or made erroneous findings. Judges have broad latitude and discretion in how they write their decisions, subject to the requirements of the Directive and basic concepts of due process. The inapplicability of certain Adjudicative Guidelines mitigating conditions does not preclude a Judge from considering whether an applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation under the general factors of Directive, Section 6.3 and Adjudicative Guidelines, Item E2.2.1. The Board does not have to agree with the Judge's findings or conclusions to decide that Department Counsel has failed to demonstrate the Judge misapplied the Adjudicative Guidelines.

	 From 1976 until 1984, Applicant smoked marijuana and experimented with multiple other drugs as a high school and college student. After college, from 1984 until 1997, he continued to smoke marijuana. During part of this time, he held a security clearance. He intentionally withheld the information related to his drug use when he completed his security clearance applications in 1990 and 2002. He did reveal his 1998 arrest for driving under the influence, but did not reveal that he was also charged with possession of marijuana. Applicant has mitigated the government's security concerns under Guidelines G and J, but has failed to overcome the security concerns as to Guidelines E and H. Clearance is denied.

	 Applicant abused marijuana with varying frequency from approximately 1977 to 1998. His illegal drug involvement led to criminal arrests for felony sale of marijuana in about 1982, for which he was sentenced to a deferred prison term and ten years probation, and for marijuana possession in 1980, 1993, 1994, and 1998. Since he was not incarcerated for any of these criminal drug charges, 10 U.S.C.  986 as amended does not apply. Yet, criminal conduct and personal conduct concerns persist where he deliberately misrepresented his marijuana involvement on his security clearance application. Clearance is denied.

	 Applicant has been a research engineer for the same defense contractor for over 35 years. In 1964, while on active military duty, Applicant's security clearance was revoked for soldier misconduct.

In 2002, Applicant was given a package containing classified material to deliver to another of his employer's facilities. He took the material home over the week-end in violation of security procedures and delivered the package the next business day. There was no security compromise. Applicant was disciplined by his employer. Applicant has received awards and commendations from his employer for his work. Applicant has mitigated security concerns for security violations and personal conduct. Clearance is granted.

	 Applicant, a native of India, acquired United States citizenship in February 2001. He holds all the key management positions with a U.S. computer company whose U.S. parent sends half of its commercial business to a subsidiary firm in India. In addition to serving as president, director, and part-owner of the U.S. parent, Applicant is a director of the subsidiary in India as well as of an independent Indian firm that he co-founded in 1986. He has financial assets in India (bank accounts, real property, a 14.63% share in the independent Indian company). His mother, siblings, and most of his in-laws are resident citizens of India. There are no foreign preference concerns where he has renounced his Indian citizenship. Potential outside activities concerns presented by his involvement with the businesses firms in India are mitigated where steps have been taken to insulate the U.S. subsidiary. Yet an unacceptable risk of undue foreign influence persists because of the ties to the companies domiciled in India, his substantial foreign assets in India, and his ties of affection and/or obligation to family members in India. Clearance is denied.

	 This 55-year-old systems analyst filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on two occasions, in 1996 and 2004. The first bankruptcy resulted from the breakup of his second marriage, which ended in divorce. The second bankruptcy resulted from his unemployment for a year prior to the bankruptcy. He has a history of filing, but not paying, his state and federal income taxes. He systematically failed to have enough state and federal taxes withheld from his paychecks. State tax liens have been levied against him in the past and he has had payment plans with the Internal Revenue Service to pay delinquent federal taxes. He mistakenly believed that both his state and federal delinquent taxes were discharged in either bankruptcy. Applicant has failed to successfully mitigate the security concern stemming from his history of not meeting financial obligations. Clearance is denied.

	 Applicant's claim of factual error by the Administrative Judge raises a question about the hearing transcript that leaves the Board unable to resolve this issue at this time in a manner that is fair to the parties. There is no indication in the case file that the parties were informed about changes to the hearing transcript that appear to have been made by the Judge. If the Board were to decide the merits of Applicant's claim of factual error at this time, it would be faced with the dilemma of deciding the evidentiary status of the hearing transcript in the case file versus the evidentiary status of the hearing transcript provided to Applicant. Such a decision would touch upon fundamental questions of due process and evidence that warrant the Board giving the parties an opportunity to be heard before such a decision is attempted.

His concurrent misdemeanor charge for drunk in public was dismissed. Four years later, Applicant was charged with Driving Under the Influence, a misdemeanor criminal offense. When completing his SF-86, Applicant stated that he had used the illicit drug ecstasy twice, when in fact he had used it three times. The security concerns raised by his criminal and personal conduct have been mitigated by the passage of time, his successful rehabilitation, and his unintentional failure to identify his last time using ecstasy.

	 Because Applicant did not deliberately omit material information from the his security clearance application (SCA) in August 2001, I find in his favor under the personal conduct guideline. Applicant's three drug offenses in the 1980s establish a pattern of criminal conduct that has not been mitigated. His lengthy 10-year sentence and eight year probation term for the December 1989 cocaine sales conviction indicates the extent of Applicant's involvement in the selling of drugs. In addition, under 10 U.S.C. 986, the Department of Defense is prohibited from granting Applicant a security clearance based on his actual incarceration for eight years of his 10 years sentence. While the Secretary of Defense may waive the statutory prohibition in meritorious cases, a waiver is not recommended. Clearance is denied.

Because the Judge's decision to not reopen the record on remand has not been shown to be arbitrary or capricious, the Board does not have to reach any conclusion as to the evidentiary sufficiency of an NSA affidavit that was offered by Department Counsel on remand. The Federal Rules of Evidence is only a guide in DOHA proceedings. The Judge properly concluded three NSA documents were admissible under Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.20, but the Judge erred by limiting their admissibility on grounds that went beyond those justified under a strict application of the Federal Rules of Evidence.

Before he won his disability case, Applicant was living on a pension since he retired from the police department, and according to him that income barely covered his rent and his car payment. Eight credit card debts, totaling $29,173, were delinquent and written off as bad debts, and eventually sold to collection agencies. With a monthly net remainder income of $1,891, he is financially irresponsible and will not pay these old debts. He refuses to pay any of the collection agencies because the credit card services will not see any of the money. Clearance is denied.

	 As a matter of judicial economy, the Board can affirm an evidentiary ruling by an Administrative Judge on any proper basis supported by the record, even if that basis was not the one relied on by the Judge. Security clearance applications signed by Applicant were admissible without an authenticating witness. Given the record evidence in this case, the Judge's finding of falsification is sustainable.

	 Applicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Married at 19 and a father by age 21, the couple held their family financially together without accruing significant debt while he attended college. With the birth of their son, however, their situation and their finances changed. His wife chose not to work, he pursued full-time employment, his son faced a medical crisis, and then his wife left them to commence an informal separation. Facing a new life as a single father, Applicant sought to return to financial stability and implemented a serious budget and debt payment plan. He had already commenced paying off his 12 principal debts when they were formally brought to his attention as part of this security clearance application process. Within six months, all but one debt was fully repaid. Applicant has mitigated security concerns. Clearance is granted.

	 Department Counsel is not required to present evidence that shows a direct or objective nexus between an applicant's conduct and circumstances and an unfavorable security clearance decision, or prove that an applicant poses a clear and present danger or imminent threat to the national security. A history of financial difficulties raises security concerns, whether it involves greed, financial irresponsibility, or financial misfortune. The presence of some mitigating evidence did not compel the Administrative Judge to make a favorable decision. Subject to review for action that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, the Judge must weigh the evidence, both favorable and unfavorable and reach a conclusion as to whether the applicant satisfied his burden of persuasion to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns raised by his history of financial difficulties. Adverse decision affirmed.

	 Application of the Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying and mitigating conditions requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.

Applicant's approximately three years of abstinence from drugs, together with his credibly stated intention not to use marijuana or cocaine in the future, successfully mitigates the security drug involvement concerns. Clearance is granted.

	 Nothing in the case file supports Applicant's claim that he was told a decision would be issued within 30 days of the hearing. Absent a showing that Applicant was prejudiced in any meaningful way, he cannot rely on the passage of time between the hearing and issuance of the Administrative Judge's decision as a basis for claiming the Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Applicant has not rebutted or overcome the presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence. Under the Directive, an applicant's security eligibility is adjudicated under the same standards regardless of whether the applicant's position requires a security clearance for access to classified information or access to a secure area.

	 Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence. The presence of conflicting record evidence does not diminish the Judge's responsibility as the trier of fact. The Judge had to consider the record evidence as a whole, assess the credibility of the testimony of Applicant and the investigator who interviewed Applicant, and make a finding as to Applicant's intent or state of mind when he completed the security clearance application. It was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to conclude Applicant had not presented evidence sufficient to mitigate his falsification of the security clearance application. The Judge properly concluded Applicant's falsification was a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001.

Furthermore, there is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise.

	 The Board need not review an Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions that have not been challenged on appeal. Given the record evidence in this case, the Judge's own findings of fact and the plain language of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1, the Judge failed to articulate a rational basis for applying that mitigating condition. The Judge's analysis under Guideline B is arbitrary and capricious and not sustainable. Department Counsel failed to demonstrate the Judge's analysis under Guideline C is erroneous. Favorable decision reversed.

Since he abstained from all other drug use since 1985, he also mitigated those concerns as his drug involvement has not been recent.

	 The Administrative Judge had to consider the conflicting record evidence and make findings as to whether Applicant's omissions from a security clearance application were deliberate or inadvertent. The Judge's findings of falsification reflect a legally permissible interpretation of the record evidence as a whole. The Board need not review findings of fact by the Judge that have not been challenged on appeal. The Judge's unchallenged findings of fact about Applicant's financial situation provide a rational basis for the Judge's conclusion that Applicant's history of financial difficulties raises security concerns under Guideline F. Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal. A promise to take remedial action in the future is not the same as evidence of actual reform and rehabilitation. Applicant does not have a right to have the record in his case kept open so that he can present evidence at some future date about changes in his financial situation. Adverse decision affirmed.

	 The record evidence does not support Applicant's claim that he was denied due process during the proceedings below. The Administrative Judge correctly concluded that the ASDC3I memorandum concerning foreign passports applied to Applicant's case. The Judge's adverse conclusions about Applicant's ties with immediate family members in Israel are sustainable. Although evidence that an applicant has a particular motive to falsify may be probative of an intent to falsify, there is no legal requirement that a particular motive to falsify be established to prove an applicant had the intent to falsify. The Judge's application of an erroneous standard about the burden of proof concerning the falsification allegation in this case was harmless and does not warrant remand. Adverse decision affirmed.

Applicant visited the website a third and final time to ascertain whether the site had been altered or removed.

	 It was legally permissible for the Administrative Judge to consider Applicant's explanation or recantation of an earlier admission in light of the record evidence as a whole and her assessment of the credibility of Applicant's testimony. Considering the record as a whole, the Judge had a sufficient basis to find that Applicant faxed, or had someone else fax, information to Israel Military Industries. Whether Applicant was reprimanded by his company in connection with the fax incident is not material to the security concerns raised by his conduct in connection with that incident. It was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to take into consideration whether Applicant admits or acknowledges responsibility for his conduct. The absence of any evidence that Applicant committed a security violation is not dispositive of this case. Mishandling of sensitive, unclassified information can provide a rational basis for an unfavorable security clearance decision. The Judge failed to articulate a rational basis for her conclusion that Applicant acted reasonably by storing documents concerning a weapon system contract in his garage during a company bankruptcy without trying to ascertain from appropriate DoD officials whether there was any governmental interest in how those documents were handled, stored, or disclosed to third parties. The Judge failed to articulate a rational basis for her conclusion that Applicant did not demonstrate poor judgment by trying to contact a reputed foreign arms dealer whom Applicant believed to be under house arrest to solicit funding for a weapon system project Applicant was trying to develop and sell. Adverse decision affirmed.

	 Applicant has a history of financial delinquency since the 1996/97 time frame due to overuse of credit. As of July 2004, he owes approximately $27,000 in delinquent debt. Financial considerations concerns persist where his efforts to resolve this debt have been minimal to date and he spent $2,500 on personal vacations instead of devoting the monies to his creditors. Personal conduct concerns exist due to his deliberate falsification of his security clearance application (SF 86) for failing to list his debts and his firing from two jobs in about 1999 for unacceptable conduct.

	 There is no right to a security clearance. Applicant has no right to, or reasonable expectation in being granted, a security clearance merely because he is a U.S. citizen. Given the record evidence in this case, the Administrative Judge had a rational basis for concluding that the totality of Applicant's conduct and circumstances raised security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) that were sufficient to warrant an unfavorable security clearance decision. Independent of Applicant's motives, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to decide whether Applicant's presence in the People's Republic of China during his trips there contributed to the security concerns raised under Guideline B.

While Applicant has always admitted drug use in the security forms and statements, he has not always been consistent in describing the types of drugs he used as well as the length of time he used those drugs.

Given the record evidence in this case, Applicant has not shown that the Judge erred by finding she has unresolved debts totaling approximately $34,000. Adverse decision affirmed.

	 Although the parties are free -- within the bounds of zealous advocacy -- to argue about what the record evidence shows, it is the Administrative Judge, not either party, that makes the findings of fact in a case. Because Department Counsel has not challenged the Judge's rulings excluding Government Exhibits 18 and 21, the Board will not consider any argument made by Department Counsel that relies on those two exhibits in support of its appeal issues. Department Counsel failed to demonstrate the Judge misapplied the Adjudicative Guidelines mitigating conditions.

	 Applicant mitigated security concerns over foreign influence as her elderly parents have lived in the U.S. and have been permanent residents since 1990. While they have elderly relatives in Vietnam, they have no ties to the government. She has limited or no contact with these elderly relatives and has not visited there since she left as a refugee in 1981. She has no plans to return for a visit. It is improbable that foreign pressure on these relatives would create a situation that could influence Applicant as she persuasively attests that should any such pressure be exerted that she would report it to her security manager and government officials. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1990 and has had a security clearance since 1997. Clearance is granted.

	 Applicant has a history of gambling abuse manifested in accumulated debts exceeding $45,000.00 during an eight-year period in the 1990s, most of which he concealed from his wife at the time. Acknowledging to himself that he had a gambling problem in 1999, he voluntarily enrolled in gamblers anonymous (GA) and tapped his 401k retirement fund for the necessary fund to repay his gambling and other debts. While Applicant has continued to gamble in local casinos, he has done so only occasionally, and never to abusive levels over the past five years. Combined with strong character references from persons who know him well at work, in his church, and in his community, Applicant successfully mitigates Government security concerns associated with his past gambling abuses.

	 A decision by a Hearing Office Administrative Judge may be cited as persuasive authority, but it is not legally binding on other Hearing Office Judges or the Board. Given the record evidence in this case, the Judge's findings and conclusions about Applicant's alcohol consumption are sustainable. Considering the record as a whole, and giving due deference to the Judge's assessment of Applicant's credibility, the Board concludes the Judge's finding of willful falsification is sustainable. For purposes of establishing falsification under Guideline E, materiality is not limited to only those matters that would support an unfavorable security clearance decision; materiality also covers information that is relevant to a security clearance investigation. Applicant has not shown the Judge erred by concluding her willful falsification was not mitigated. Adverse decision affirmed.

	 Twenty-three-year old Applicant abused marijuana on approximately 100 occasions, until at least August 2003. He continued to do so, and lied about it, after he was: convicted of possession of marijuana in 2001; questioned about such use in his SF 86; granted an interim security clearance; and interviewed by DIS. Until August 2004, his verbal commitment to marijuana was cavalier and steadfast: "I do not care if I violate the law . . . when it pertains to marijuana because I think marijuana should be legalized." His refusal to discontinue his association with drug users and drug dealers was unshakeable. His recent vow to avoid marijuana in the future, when compared to his earlier actions and statements leaves grave doubts as to his security eligibility. Furthermore, 10 U.S.C.  986 disqualifies him from eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied.

	 Applicant fell behind on 16 debts totaling $43,256.49. These debts were incurred in large part by his ex-wife during his last deployment before retiring from the Army. Upon his return from this deployment, she sued him for divorce. An additional security concern arose by his failure to list his delinquent debts on his security clearance application. Applicant demonstrated this omission was not intentional. Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve all 16 debts.

	 Applicant began using marijuana in about September 1992 while he held a secret security clearance for his work as a student researcher at a university-affiliated research laboratory. He continued to smoke marijuana on average twice per year until approximately August 2002. After being interviewed for his continued suitability for access to classified information, Applicant realized drug use could negatively jeopardize his clearance so he resolved to abstain in the future. Applicant has been drug free since and intends no future involvement. While there is little risk of future drug use, his disregard of the laws pertaining to illegal drug use reflects extremely poor judgment. Clearance is denied.
