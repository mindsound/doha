	 Applicant, a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor, was arrested in January 2000 while on active duty with the Navy and charged with larceny at a base exchange. He was brought before a captain's mast, pled guilty, and received non-judicial punishment of a letter of reprimand. Applicant falsified information about the incident on two security clearance applications (SF 86) in 2002 and 2003, and to a security investigator in 2002. Clearance is denied.

	 Nothing in Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or generally applicable principles of federal administrative law entitles Applicant to expect or receive the assistance of DoD personnel as surrogate advocates for him. Having decided to represent himself in the proceedings below, Applicant cannot fairly complain that he did not do a better job to prepare and present his case for the Administrative Judge to consider. The Judge's findings about Applicant's multiple acts of falsification are supported by the record evidence. The absence of vulnerability to blackmail or coercion does not preclude a Judge from considering whether an applicant's conduct or circumstances raise security concerns unrelated to such a vulnerability. Except for the possibility of two errors that would be harmless under the particular facts of this case, Applicant has not shown the Judge's application of the Adjudicative Guidelines was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Adverse decision affirmed.

The listed debts total over $25,000.00 and remain significant (save for three which have been resolved) after some earlier unsuccessful debt consolidation efforts. Applicant's repayment efforts remain too much a work in progress to make any safe predictable judgments at this time about his debt resolution prospects. Additionally, Applicant omitted most of his debts when answering his June 2002 security clearance application.

	 Fifty-four-year-old Applicant--the victim of a scam--scrambled to save $300,000.00 in investments (originally on a scheme to triple his money). His greed led him to a pattern of breaking the law by writing checks on accounts with insufficient funds, kiting checks, forging his wife's name on checks written against her account, and embezzling funds from a non-profit civic organization for which he was the interim treasurer. He was convicted of attempted theft 2<SUP>nd</SUP> degree and sentenced to 365 days in jail (suspended), fined $5,000.00 (suspended), placed on unsupervised probation for one year, and the sentence was deferred for one year. One year later, the court ordered the finding of guilt to be withdrawn and the cause to be dismissed with prejudice. Grave questions and doubts remain as to his security eligibility and suitability.

	 Applicant's financial problems arose during a six month period in 1996-1997 in which he was unemployed. Therefore, Mitigating Condition 3 is applicable to Applicant's initial financial delinquencies. However, it does not completely absolve his failure to resolve his financial delinquencies over the last seven years. Although Applicant has settled a delinquent automobile loan and rehabilitated his student loan, he has failed to mitigate a delinquent automobile loan that resulted in judgment against him in 2001 in the amount of $5, 594.00. Applicant has also failed to demonstrate that he paid the two smallest debts addressed by the SOR or that another debt to a bank resulted from excessive charges. In addition, his contention that one debt is duplicated by the SOR is not supported by evidence of record. Clearance is denied.

	 Under the Directive, the Board is not authorized to review the record evidence de novo and make its own findings of fact. The Board does not have to agree with the Administrative Judge's findings of fact to conclude they are supported by substantial record evidence. It is untenable for Department Counsel to challenge the Judge's decision by trying to raise -- for the first time on appeal -- allegations of falsification not covered by the Statement of Reasons. Apart from the Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying and mitigating conditions, a Judge must evaluate an applicant's case under the general factors of Directive, Section 6.3 and Adjudicative Guidelines, Item E2.2.1. Department Counsel has not shown that the Judge's error concerning Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 2 is harmful in this case. Favorable decision affirmed.

The security significance of Applicant's drinking in February 2004 is not reduced or diminished merely because it did not result in an arrest or other involvement with law enforcement officials. The Judge had a rational basis for deciding to not apply Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions 2 and 3.

	 The Board is directed to address the material issues raised by the parties on appeal. When faced with a problem on appeal that precludes the Board from addressing in a fair and meaningful way the material issues raised by the parties on appeal, the Board is -- of practical necessity -- required to decide whether the threshold problem can be resolved so the Board can decide an appeal on its merits, or whether the threshold problem requires remand for corrective action that the Board cannot take. The case record in this case is not coherent or intelligible about the identity, evidentiary status, and handling of documents submitted by Applicant after the hearing. Furthermore, there appear to be three documents that were submitted by Applicant after the hearing that are not in the case file. Given the state of the case file, the appeal rights of the parties and the ability of the Board to carry out its appellate functions have been significantly impaired. Case remanded with instructions.

	 While Applicant's financial problems raised security concerns because of his delay in resolving debts to several creditors, he demonstrated his consistent, good-faith effort to resolve his federal and state tax debts as soon as he found stable employment in a new field. He resolved his tax debts in full and also resolved a debt to one creditor for office supplies. His debts stem from a business failure and not from an extravagant lifestyle. He has reduced his overall debt substantially and intends in the future to resolve the remaining debts even though under the state statute of limitations he has no legal obligation to do so as those creditors did not file timely claims. He has demonstrated he is now financial responsible and has a stable job. He rebutted personal conduct concerns and established he was not responsible for a creditor's difficulty in serving him with their complaint. Clearance is granted.

Applicant has been paying child support regularly for more than two years, has reduced the arrearage to $9,889.00, and intends to pay it in full. He has obtained credit counseling to put his finances in order. He is receiving psychiatric counseling to deal with his resentment toward his ex-wife. Applicant has mitigated his previous record of not meeting financial obligations. Clearance is granted.

Given the record evidence in this case, the Judge articulated a rational basis for why he concluded that Applicant had not extenuated or mitigated the security concerns raised by her ties to, and contacts with, her father and four brothers who are citizens and residents of the People's Republic of China. The Judge's decision reflects an analysis consistent with the whole person concept. Board does not review isolated sentences of a Judge's decision, but rather considers the decision in its entirety to ascertain what findings of fact the Judge made and what conclusions the Judge reached. Decisions by Hearing Office Judges are not legally binding precedent on their colleagues in other cases. There is no merit to Applicant's claim that the Judge made a biased decision. Adverse decision affirmed.

	 Applicant has a history of financially delinquent accounts that have been reduced to civil judgment or charged off. While three judgment debts have been repaid through garnishment of his wages, he still owes about $14,500 in old debt. He is currently meeting his day-to-day expenses, has incurred no new credit card debt, but has inadequate finances available to repay these old delinquencies. His failure to report all his debts on his security clearance application was not deliberate so it does not raise Personal Conduct concerns, but his financial situation remains tenuous.

	 Nothing in the Directive indicates or suggests that the government can deny or revoke access to classified information only if it alleges and proves an applicant's actions or circumstances fall under the Guideline pertaining to criminal conduct. Applicant's history of financial difficulties raises security concerns that the government can consider in evaluating his security eligibility. The Administrative Judge's findings about Applicant's falsification of a security clearance application and failure to provide relevant and material information to the government also provide a rational basis for the Judge's unfavorable conclusions.

The earlier offenses have been mitigated by the passing of time but the security clearance omission and recent excessive use of alcohol results in a finding against Applicant. Clearance is denied.

	 Applicant has only established her resolution of two of the ten delinquent debts addressed by the SOR that amount to $1,541.00 of the $9,905.00 of indebtedness. After ample opportunity, her failure to document her assertion that she is back on regular payments of $73,144.00 student loan creates doubt as to whether she has done so. So too does her failure to demonstrate improved financial status by documenting that she has paid off a car loan. Supporting two children, including an autistic child, as a single parent, as well as her mother undoubtedly contribute to her financial condition. However, these circumstances do not totally excuse her failure to mitigate her indebtedness by at least demonstrating a functioning plan for resolving it. Clearance is denied.

	 There is a rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise. Subject to review for arbitrary and capricious action, a Judge is entitled to weigh the evidence and can decide whether some evidence is entitled to great weight, some weight, or no weight at all. As to factual matters, the Judge's findings must satisfy the substantial evidence test. A favorable security clearance decision should not be made unless there is an affirmative determination that it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for a given applicant. The burden of persuasion that all applicants must satisfy, regardless of the Guideline involved, is the clearly consistent with the national interest standard. Applicant has failed to show the Judge's adverse conclusions under Guideline B are arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law. Adverse decision affirmed.

	 Applicant used marijuana in Vietnam from 1970 to 1971, and two or three times from 1971 to 1976. In June 1991, Applicant executed a sworn statement in which he denied any marijuana use since 1971. Following a hearing in December 1992 at which Applicant testified he had not used marijuana since 1970, his clearance was continued by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). During a reinvestigation of his background in February 2001, Applicant admitted he took puffs off marijuana cigarettes on two or three occasions from 1971 to 1976. His inconsistent statements about his marijuana use raise doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Personal Conduct concerns are further compounded by his violations of security practices at his place of employment, including leaving a gate open and unattended in 1999, failing to properly secure a closed area in 2000, and allowing an unauthorized vehicle access to the facility in 2001.

In December 1984, he married in South Korea a native of that country who he had met on a trip to see relatives. They established their home and had children in the U.S., while Applicant worked for a succession of U.S. firms where he was granted security clearance. In 1996, he took a job in South Korea working on commercial projects, but moved his family back to the U.S. in July 2000 due to concerns about his children's education and work demands in South Korea.

	 Applicant is 39 years old. He works for a defense contractor. He was arrested in 1983 when he was 19 years old on several theft charges. He was sentenced on those charges to more than one year in jail, but they were suspended and he served three years probation. Since that time he has married, been employed steadily, and is a law-abiding resident of his state. Applicant mitigated the criminal justice security concerns. The Smith Amendment (10 U.S.C. § 986) applies and disqualifies him for a security clearance without a waiver. I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. § 986.

	 Absent unusual circumstances, a flaw or failing with the synopsis of an Administrative Judge's decision is not likely to demonstrate harmful error. Harmless factual errors by the Judge do not warrant remand or reversal. The facts and circumstances of Applicant's family ties with relatives in Lebanon and Syria provide a rational basis for the Judge's conclusion that there are security concerns under Guideline B that Applicant had to refute, rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate. Absence of a foreign preference does not negate security concerns raised under Guideline B. Applicant's disagreement with the Judge's adverse conclusions is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the record evidence and analyzed Applicant's case in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

	 Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal. Given the record evidence in this case, the Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions about Applicant's unresolved financial difficulties are sustainable. The Judge properly concluded that Applicant's 1996 conviction falls under the scope of 10 U.S.C. 986. Given the applicability of 10 U.S.C. 986 to Applicant's case, the Judge was precluded from concluding Applicant's criminal conduct was successfully mitigated under Guideline J and making a favorable security clearance decision. Because the Board is not affirming the Judge's decision solely based on the applicability of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Board is not authorized to make any recommendation as to whether Applicant's case should be considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. 986(d).

	 Born in Vietnam, Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns over foreign influence resulting from his ties to Vietnam. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1993. When he returned to Vietnam in 1995, he was repeatedly questioned and threatened by Vietnamese officials and was forced to pay these officials at each meeting. After a local police chief also threatened him, he gave that official a large sum of money. Based on his past response to these threats, there is substantial likelihood that he could be subject to duress again. Thus foreign influence could create a situation that could result in the compromise of classified information.

	 Even if an applicant were able to present credible evidence of misconduct by a DSS Agent, such evidence would not entitle the applicant to a favorable security clearance decision. An applicant is not entitled to a favorable security clearance decision based on a claim of equitable estoppel. Although the exclusionary rule does not apply in DOHA proceedings, an applicant is not precluded from asking a Judge to give little or no weight to an applicant's prior written statement based on a claim that the written statement was the product of coercion or duress. However, an applicant seeking to attack a prior written statement must do more than just make a claim of impropriety by a DSS Agent.

	 DOHA Administrative Judges do not have authority to adjudicate foreign policy and foreign relations issues in security clearance cases. Pronouncements about the relationship between the United States and any given foreign country are committed to the President of the United States, the Secretary of State, and other duly authorized Executive Branch officials. DOHA proceedings are intended to adjudicate an applicant's security eligibility, not to adjudicate claims by the defense contracting industry. Nothing in Executive Order 10865 or the Directive give Hearing Office Judges or the Board jurisdiction to adjudicate claims by third parties about the merits or collateral consequences of a security clearance adjudication. A party claiming that he or she has been denied due process in these proceedings must raise such a claim with particular specificity. The application of Adjudicative Guidelines for or against clearance is not reducible to a simple formula and requires the exercise of sound judgment, within the parameters of the Directive, after consideration of the record evidence as a whole.

	 Once a case has been appealed, the Board has jurisdiction over the case and the Hearing Office Administrative Judge has no jurisdiction or authority to take any action concerning that case.

Because Applicant's third alcohol-related offense in September 1985 resulted in a prison sentence of more than a year, the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 986 preclude the granting of a security clearance without the waiver of the Secretary of Defense. Clearance is denied.

	 Nothing in Executive Order 10865 or the Directive indicates that an applicant must be granted a security clearance unless the applicant's conduct and circumstances fall under or implicates all or most of the 13 Guidelines listed in the Directive. The presence of some mitigating evidence does not compel the Administrative Judge to make a favorable decision. The Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. Applicant's reliance on the decision in Nickelson v. United States (284 F. Supp.2d 387) is misplaced. The Judge erred by finding Applicant falsified a security questionnaire by answering NO to question 29 because there was no record evidence that Applicant had been involved in a drug transaction for his profit or the profit of another person or entity; however, the Judge's error is harmless under the particular facts and circumstances of this case. Adverse decision affirmed.

	 There is no general requirement for an Administrative Judge to discuss each and every piece of record evidence. The Board does not have to agree with the Judge's reasoning or analysis in this case to conclude that Department Counsel has failed to make a persuasive argument that the Judge impermissibly shifted the burden of persuasion away from Applicant. Because of the limits of the Board's authority under the Directive and because there is no presumption of error below, (a) a Judge's unchallenged findings and conclusions will be allowed to stand, and (b) a Judge's challenged findings and conclusions will be allowed to stand if the appealing party fails to demonstrate error below. Favorable decision affirmed.

	 Applicant's alcohol abuse has resulted in at least three alcohol-related incidents, the first taking place in 1995 and the last in 2001. Applicant continues to consume alcohol to the point of intoxication. Evidence of Applicant's alcohol rehabilitation is not sufficient to mitigate his alcohol related history. Additionally, in a signed, sworn 2002 Security Clearance Application (SCA) supplied to the Government, Applicant failed to disclose his alcohol related arrest and conviction in 2001. Clearance is denied.

	 Applicant was convicted of theft in 1997, sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for two years (suspended) and placed on four years probation. He successfully completed all conditions of his sentence and was released from probation on November 13, 2001. He failed to disclose the repossession of an automobile in a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) he submitted on August 6, 2001, but credibly explained he believed the repossession had occurred more than seven years prior to the submission of the SF 86. Applicant has mitigated the security concern caused by his personal conduct, but is unable to mitigate the security concern his criminal conduct has created because of the statutory disqualification imposed by 10 U.S.C. § 986. Clearance is denied. I do recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver.

	 The Administrative Judge was not required to accept Applicant's explanation about why he failed to disclose several delinquent debts when he completed a security clearance application in March 2001. Considering the record as a whole, the Judge's decision to reject Applicant's explanation was legally permissible and sustainable. Given the Judge's findings about Applicant's long history of financial difficulties, the Judge's adverse conclusions under Guideline F are not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Adverse decision affirmed.
