Applicant is fully integrated into U.S. society with a husband she married in 2001 and their child who are both U.S. citizens. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2005; her travels to Estonia are to visit her parents.

Of that amount, $40,509 relates to a mortgage foreclosure and $16,220 consists of ten consumer debts.

	 Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns over her drug use with her history of recent marijuana use since 2002 to June 2007, including use after she completed her security questionnaire in 2006. While she claims no current use since July 2007 and plans to stop use if granted a security clearance, such a prospective promise does not sufficiently demonstrate she has mitigated concerns because of the recency of her past use and her maturity when she began use. As the evidence of current use and drug addiction is not established, the conditions that trigger the Smith Amendment have not been proven. However, security concerns persist over her recent drug use and her casual attitude towards illegal drug use. Clearance is denied.

From 1995 to 2005, he operated his own consulting business in the U.S. While he provided translation services to a Taiwanese company maintaining a satellite ground station built by U.S. companies, he had several U.S. clients as well, and his work predated his U.S. defense contractor employment. Applicant obtained a Taiwanese passport in about 1998 for convenience when traveling between the U.S. and Taiwan to care for his ill mother. The foreign preference concerns are mitigated by the destruction of the Taiwanese passport with expressed renunciation of Taiwanese citizenship. Foreign influence concerns exist because of the Taiwanese residency and citizenship of his father and brother, but Applicant is likely to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. where he and his mother make their home. Clearance is granted.

However, when he was interviewed by two investigators, he reported the information to the first but only after being asked about it, and told the second one that he had reported the information on his SF 86. He mitigated criminal conduct security concerns arising from the same incidents he failed to reveal because of the passage of time and no further incidents since 2002. Clearance is denied.

	 Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns over his personal conduct, sexual behavior and criminal conduct based on his long history of following minor children and masturbating in his car from 1985 to 1997 which ultimately led to his arrest and guilty plea in 1998 to a misdemeanor charge of Public Sexual Indecency. He waited until January 2007 to seek treatment, so he is still in the early stages. Security concerns persist despite a favorable prognosis from his therapist. While he has taken some steps to reform his conduct, he failed to demonstrate sufficient positive changes in behavior, especially in light of the potential for blackmail and duress as he failed to divulge his past misconduct either to his current wife or family and friends. Consequently, security concerns remain over personal conduct, sexual behavior and criminal conduct. Clearance is denied.

	 The question of whether there is sufficient evidence to support a Judge's factual findings is a matter of law. Applicant's denials and explanations are not conclusive evidence. Rather, Applicant's statements, whether written or in the form of hearing testimony, had to be considered in light of the record evidence as a whole. An Administrative Judge is not required to accept testimony merely because it is unrebutted. In determining whether there is sufficient record evidence to support a Judge's findings, the Board will consider not just whether there is record evidence consistent with the Judge's findings, but will also consider whether there is evidence that detracts from the Judge's findings.

	 Applicant's history of financial problems began when he did not pay his federal tax for 2003 and 2004. The financial difficulties continued with Applicant's abuse of five credit cards in 2003, 2004, and 2005. In addition, he deliberately falsified his security form in September 2005 when he certified he had no overdue debts. Though he had to be confronted with the debt information before he admitted the listed debts, the unambiguous acceptance of his falsehoods and actions he took to rectify the debt problems gives me sufficient grounds to find the financial and personal conduct guidelines in his favor. Clearance is granted.

	 Applicant was born in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) to parents of Chinese descent and emigrated to the U.S. in 1997. Since emigrating to the U.S., Applicant has earned an engineering degree from a reputable American university, become a naturalized U.S. citizen, and established himself as a reliable and trusted engineer with a U.S. defense contractor. Applicant's birth father, maternal grandparents, and maternal aunt are citizens of the PRC, reside in the PRC, and are presumably close to Applicant despite his occasional contacts with them. Each of his immediate family members remain in a position that could realistically make them vulnerable to coercion or pressure that could implicate Applicant and compel him to make decisions about competing loyalties. Applicant fails to mitigate potential risks to undue foreign influence concerns caused by the status of his father and other family members living in the PRC. Applicant successfully refuted allegations that he falsified his security clearance application by omitting prior possession and use of a Chinese passport. Clearance is denied.

	 Based on an assessment of her as a whole person, Applicant mitigated security concerns over foreign influence. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in December 2003, is recommended for a security clearance by her corporate superiors, and is fully integrated into U.S. society. One sister is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Since1997, all her immediate family members have had a Green Card. All are seeking U.S. citizenship except for her father and grandmother who are citizens of China and residents of Macao. I conclude it is improbable that foreign pressure on her relatives could create a situation that could result in the compromise of classified information as Applicant attests she would report any attempt to the appropriate U.S. official. Also, Applicant asked that her foreign passport be destroyed in 2006; so foreign preference concerns are similarly mitigated. Clearance is granted.

	 Based on an assessment of him as a whole person, Applicant mitigated security concerns over foreign influence as he is fully integrated into U.S. society and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in December 2000. Notably, his mother, also a naturalized U.S. citizen since1996, works as a civilian for a military organization and has been granted a security clearance. While his father, grandfather and his wife's parents are citizens and residents of China. I conclude it is improbable that foreign pressure on his relatives could create a situation that could result in the compromise of classified information as Applicant attests he would report any attempt to the appropriate U.S. official. Also, Applicant's failure to register with the U.S. Selective Service at 18 was not a deliberate disregard of U.S. legal requirements. Clearance is granted.

He is a vice-president and part-owner of a successful family business, and he is involved in community affairs. His demonstrated ability to lead a responsible and productive life for a significant period after conviction and release from confinement is strong evidence of reform and rehabilitation. But because he was incarcerated for not less than one year, he is statutorily disqualified from being granted a security clearance by the Defense Department unless a waiver is granted. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied solely as a result of 10 U.S.C.  986(c)(1).

	 Applicant is 41 years old and has consumed alcohol, at times to excess, for over 25 years. In 2006, he was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) twice in 2005, for which he is still on probation. He received inpatient alcohol treatment in 1988. During outpatient treatment in 2005 and 2006, he was diagnosed as alcohol-dependent, and he consumed alcohol during his treatment. Applicant deliberately lied to the police, and to government investigators and clearance adjudicators about his drinking, and about the details of a minor traffic accident in 2006. He failed to mitigate the resulting security concerns about his alcohol consumption, criminal conduct, and personal conduct. Clearance is denied.

	 In DOHA proceedings, the Federal Rules of Evidence serve only as a guide. They may be relaxed by the Judge in order to permit the development of a full and complete record by the parties. The DOHA process encourages Judges to err on the side of initially admitting evidence into the record, and then to consider a party's objections when deciding what weight to give to that evidence. DOHA proceedings are conducted before impartial, professional fact-finders, there is less concern about the prejudicial effect of specific items of evidence than there is in proceedings conducted before a lay jury. The document at issue was relevant in evaluating possible mitigation of the trustworthiness concerns raised by Applicant's drug-related conduct. It is understandable that Department Counsel would want an opportunity to cross examine the psychiatrist. The Board concludes that there is no reason to believe that Applicant was attempting to obtain an unfair advantage. The Judge should have admitted the document into evidence, and then considered Department Counsel's objection in deciding what weight should be given to the exhibit. Having denied admission of the document, it was arbitrary and capricious for the Judge to then rely on part of it in reaching his conclusions. The error is not harmless and no argument has been presented to sustain the decision on other grounds. The case is remanded to the Judge with instruction that he reopen the record, admit Applicant's Attachment 1 into evidence, allow Department Counsel the opportunity to submit rebuttal evidence, and allow both parties the opportunity to submit additional arguments.

However, during a period of employment between November 2003 and January 2006, Applicant could have taken steps to repay some of her creditors. Her inaction grounds a finding against her under the financial guideline. Clearance is denied.

Those who know the Applicant, to include two retired Air Force Colonels, recommend him for a security clearance. Mitigation is shown. Clearance is granted.

	 The Federal Rules of evidence serve only as a guide. They may be relaxed by the Judge in order to permit the development of a full and complete record by the parties. Official notice in administrative proceedings is broader than judicial notice. The DOHA process encourages Judges to err on the side of admitting evidence into the record, and then to consider a party's objections when deciding what weight to give to it. There is less concern about prejudicial effect of specific items of evidence than in judicial proceedings conducted before a lay jury. Citation to a court decision is generally permissible. However, DOHA decisions are about the security suitability of the Applicant in the given case. Judges and parties are cautioned against reaching too far when they cite to the legal outcome of another person's case or the conduct of a person not before DOHA. Court decisions evidencing a single, anecdotal, incident of espionage on behalf of a foreign country, are not particularly probative as to the overall political and intelligence profile of that country <EM>vis-a-vis</EM> the United States. Therefore, such documents should be accorded considerably less weight than official executive branch documents and reports describing the political and intelligence profile, or the human rights record, of a foreign country.

When Applicant became aware of her indebtedness as a result of these proceedings, she made a good-faith effort to pay or resolve all her debts. Her honest belief she had no debt explains her denying she had any debt over 180 days delinquent on her Public Trust Position Application. Having mitigated financial considerations and personal conduct concerns, designation to hold a position of trust is granted.

	 Applicant has 11 delinquent debts with an approximate balance of $12,443. Her current financial situation is complicated by her recent divorce and her ex-husband's failure to provide child support for their three-year-old daughter. Applicant's plan to pay her debts one at a time is not sufficient to mitigate the financial considerations concern. She indicates that she does not have much money left over each month, so it is too soon to conclude that she will be able to follow her debt repayment plan. She has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised under financial considerations. Applicant's eligibility for a assignment to a sensitive position is denied.
