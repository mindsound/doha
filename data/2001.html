	 Applicant's long-term marijuana abuse was discovered by his employer's random drug tests in June 1998 despite his adulterating his first urine sample. He used marijuana again, and then tested positive. Despite his successful drug treatment and favorable prognosis by an expert who evaluated him, Applicant's extensive use of marijuana while he had a clearance is too recent to conclude beyond doubt that he can be trusted to avoid any drug use in the future. After he was granted a security clearance in 1979 and knew of the Government's prohibition against drug use, Applicant used amphetamines until September 1990, cocaine until 1990, and marijuana until at least June 1998. Another security concern is his personal conduct in providing misleading information at the time of a random drug test and on his 1996 Security Clearance Application. Clearance is denied.

Applicant neglected to disclose adverse financial information required in response to five questions on the form. These security form falsifications due to his negligence underpin security concerns over his personal conduct. With respect to his misleading answers in his November 2000 response to interrogatories from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), Applicant was confused and had no intent to falsify. He had no criminal intent to falsify and was never charged, so the criminal conduct concerns are resolved in his favor. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns over his personal conduct.

Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant had engaged in the exercise of dual citizenship without a factual finding which supported that conclusion. Judge properly considered the conditional nature of Applicant's statements about his willingness to renounce his foreign country citizenship. Fact that Department of Defense did not ask Applicant to renounce his foreign country citizenship did not preclude Judge from considering Applicant's statements about whether he is willing to renounce his foreign country citizenship. The Judge had a sufficient basis to conclude Applicant has not demonstrated a principal preference for the United States over a foreign country. Harmless error by Judge does not warrant remand or reversal. Adverse decision affirmed.

	 Security concerns remain over Applicant's foreign preference galvanized by his dual citizenship and his repeated use of his foreign passport (which he renewed in December 2000) after he became a naturalized United States (US) citizen in April1992 and had a US passport. He traveled on his Lebanese 17 times, including a July 2001 visit after he received the Statement of Reasons (SOR) expressing security concerns over this use. In January 2001, he stated that he would relinquish the passport if necessary, but he did not chose to do so until September 2001. His mere assertion of an exclusive preference for the US is insufficient. On the other hand he has mitigated the allegations of foreign influence. Although his wife and his relatives are citizens of a foreign country, there is no evidence that they have ties to the government, are agents of a foreign power, or could be exploited by a foreign power in a way that would force him to choose between his ties to them and to the US.

	 Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns over foreign preference prompted by his dual citizenship: after he became a naturalized US citizen in August 1985, he possessed a foreign passport and used this foreign passport for trips to Iran in 1994 and 1998. He has not relinquished the foreign passport which expires in October 2001 and has not acted to document his exclusive preference for the US. (The fact that the government of Iran does not allow people born in Iran to travel to Iran with a US passport does not mitigate the use of a foreign passport under current US security policy.) While his parents and siblings are citizens of this foreign country and reside there, the ties are so casual and infrequent that he would not be subject to foreign influence. Clearance is denied.

	 Applicant's drug abuse started in 1991 with marijuana and continued until February 2001, including repeated use even after he applied for a security clearance and made a commitment to himself and the government to remain drug-free. In 1994-98 he experimented with a variety of other drugs and purchased and sold marijuana and LSD on a limited scale in college. Since his drug use other than marijuana as well as his drug purchases and sales were confined to his college days (1994-98) and not subsequently repeated, that involvement can be mitigated.

	 Applicant's drug abuse began in 1996 with marijuana, cocaine, LSD, and Valium during high school and during a period of family crisis as his parents' divorce was followed by his mother's death. While those difficulties do not excuse his drug use, those circumstances put it in context. He continued to use and purchase marijuana until July 2000 when he made a believable commitment to cease using any drugs. He now has a year of abstinence that is supported not simply by his own testimony, but also by his sister who has also noted his increased maturity, and by his manager who has noted his continual improvement at work which led to a recent promotion. Thus, I conclude he has been able to demonstrate his commitment to avoid any drug use for over a year and has had a subsequent clean drug test. Clearance is granted.

	 Applicant's conduct raises security concerns over his criminal conduct, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and personal conduct. Applicant deliberately misled the Government by material omissions from his security form. Thus, the Government established a case of personal conduct and criminal falsification under 18 U.S.C. section 1001 as he was clearly put on notice that he had a duty to reveal all adverse information on the SF 86. Instead, he improperly certified that his answers were "true, complete, and correct." While he has mitigated, in part, the allegation of continuing to abuse alcohol as he stopped drinking, he did not mitigate the overall concern over his alcohol abuse as he has not demonstrated twelve months of sobriety in his after care program. He mitigated the drug abuse charge as he stopped using drugs and has had subsequent clean drug tests. Clearance is denied.
