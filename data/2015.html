	Applicant was for many years a decorated combat warrior who spent significant periods deployed. He maintained strong dedication to his military and civilian service while paying less attention to his marital and financial issues. His numerous deployments hampered his ability to ensure his taxes were timely filed. He was clearly naive about financial matters. Even after learning that his wife had not timely filed their federal income tax return for the tax year 2008, he continued to rely on her to file subsequent income tax returns. Applicant may have been confused regarding when and by whom his federal income tax returns were filed, but he was not ignorant of his legal responsibilities, even though he had not obtained any financial guidance. His failure to take more timely decisive action during the three-year period from April 2009 through April 2011 is acknowledged. However, he finally took the first step in resolving the 2008, 2009, and 2010 taxes when he engaged the professional services of a tax consulting company to represent him in negotiations with the IRS to resolve his federal income tax liability. Those federal income tax returns were either filed by the tax consulting company or constructed by the IRS for him. Applicant has in place a repayment arrangement with the IRS. Under his installment agreement, he makes a monthly payment of $1,502 to the IRS. There are no longer doubts as to Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Eligibility is granted.

	In December 2005, while he was working on a temporary assignment in his hometown, some 345 miles from his permanent duty location, without any assurances that the assignment would become long-term, Applicant purchased a residence for $114,900. The financial problems associated with the national economic crisis subsequently resulted in massive layoffs in his field. It also terminated his anticipated relocation. Applicant was able to sustain his first and second mortgages while his sister resided in the residence. Once she moved out and he was unable to locate renters, the financial burden began as he was required to make his monthly mortgage payments in addition to his rent payments. The burden was simply too great. Applicant tried selling the residence, but three short-sales fell through when the first mortgage lender refused to agree to the sales. The residence remained vacant for nearly eight months. The first mortgage holder foreclosed on the mortgage, and in May 2014, the property was sold at public auction for $20,100. No deficiency judgment was pursued. Applicant still owes the second mortgage holder the unpaid balance of that mortgage, but Applicant’s attorney is attempting to work with his second mortgage creditor in an effort to settle the outstanding balance. Applicant has no other delinquent accounts. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Eligibility is granted.

	Applicant’s criminal history is lengthy and varied. It commenced in 1999, when he was 19 years old, and continued until 2010, when he was 29 years old. Applicant was involved in a number of incidents that resulted in arrests, criminal charges, convictions, and sentences. He was also acquitted of some charges and other charges were dismissed. Some of the incidents involved alcohol, some involved marijuana and LSD, and others were a combination of alcohol and a hot temper. Influenced by too much alcohol, Applicant soon found himself in a spiral of self-destruction becoming involved in an extensive array of criminal conduct. Nothing fazed him, for arrests, convictions, jail, probation, and fines, had no positive impact on him. His environment – undergraduate and graduate school – was generally the environment of alcohol and marijuana. In addition, he encountered financial difficulties. Applicant grew up in poverty, and never developed an appreciation for self-control. While he was apparently book-smart, his social skills were associated with naivety, and he used alcohol or marijuana to fit in with his peers. Once Applicant escaped his university environment and entered his current professional environment, things changed. A new paradigm was established when Applicant cast aside his criminal behavior, ceased using marijuana, and stopped consuming alcohol. He has abstained from marijuana since January 2008. He embraced abstinence from alcohol in June 2011. There have been no criminal incidents since 2010. Given his appreciation of life without the burdens of alcohol and marijuana, his good employment record, and his repeatedly stated remorse for his past actions, Applicant appears to have been successfully rehabilitated, and his criminal conduct is unlikely to recur. It no longer casts doubt on Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. He has resolved all of his delinquent debts, and there are clear indications that his financial problems are under control. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Clearance is granted

additional debt and the passage of time without meaningful debt resolution constitute significant

He attempted to save his primary residence and a rental property, but was unable to do so. Applicant had three accounts with relatively minor balances that were delinquent and placed for collection. Once he learned of their existence and located the proper creditors, he paid those accounts in full. A federal tax lien was the unfortunate result of miscommunication between the state and the IRS which led to the IRS treating Applicant’s destroyed business as a continuing enterprise. The IRS eventually corrected the error and released the lien. The failure to file his income tax returns was due to his reliance on his accountant’s filing the returns under his power of attorney.

	Applicant’s initial financial problems started in November 2010 when he and his wife separated and continued to May 2013 when they were finally divorced. His finances were dramatically impacted when his wife was awarded a significant portion of the family assets, and he was made responsible for the family liabilities, including the cost of relocating his wife’s mother across country. Applicant reduced discretionary expenses and attempted to continue paying his creditors to the best of his ability. Nevertheless, some accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection or charged off. In April 2014, he filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13. As of December 2014, Applicant had paid the bankruptcy trustee $11,500 to be disbursed among his creditors. Applicant pays the trustee $2,000 each month, and it is anticipated that by August 2016, his delinquencies will be eliminated. The divorce court ordered the parties to jointly file for the tax years 2011 and 2012. Applicant complied with the requirement that he provide his wife all the documentation so she could have the forms completed and filed by a specific tax preparation service. It was Applicant’s ex-wife who failed to timely file their income tax return. Applicant did not discover that fact until 2013 when the tax preparation service submitted documentation for his signature for both tax years 2011 and 2012. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Eligibility is granted.
