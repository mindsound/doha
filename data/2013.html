He demonstrated a meaningful track record of debt reduction and elimination by paying off several SOR and non-SOR accounts, and by entering repayment agreements with other creditors. There are clear indications that his financial problems are being resolved and are under control. In addition, he routinely consumed alcohol to excess. He attended several alcohol programs, and, after some slips, which he referred to as relapses, he finally acknowledged that he did not get it right the first time when he continued to consume alcohol. Applicant admits that he has a drinking problem, and considers himself to be an alcoholic. He has vowed not to consume alcohol in the future. Applicant successfully completed outpatient counseling and has voluntarily entered the aftercare program.

	Ever since 2002, Applicant has been experiencing financial difficulties that have resulted in accounts being placed for collection, charged off, or filed as judgments. Although some of those delinquent accounts were for balances as little as $162, Applicant failed to take any meaningful action to resolve them. Instead, he started the Chapter 13 bankruptcy process in 2002, but quickly abandoned it. He purportedly spoke with creditors about resolving some accounts, but has no documentation to support his contentions. He tried debt consolidation, but then abandoned it. He supposedly was enrolled in a debt repayment plan with the IRS, but abandoned it as well. Now, he plans to refile for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Applicant could have made some reasonable timely efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts, but there is little evidence that he has done so. Applicant has demonstrated the absence of a meaningful track record in addressing his delinquent accounts. Applicant’s actions indicate a lack of judgment, which raises questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Clearance is denied.

	Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his past history of alcohol abuse and intentional falsification of his security clearance applications. Three years ago, Applicant consumed alcohol and committed a serious criminal offense while under the effects of an alcohol-induced blackout. Although he has taken some positive steps to overcome his alcohol issues, he did not establish that a similar situation is unlikely to recur. Applicant also deliberately falsified two separate security clearance applications regarding the extent of his past drug use. He did so in order to secure a job. He took responsibility for his conduct at the hearing, but his past dishonesty and decision to place his own interests over his security obligations continues to raise doubts about his current eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied.

	<p class="digest">
	Applicant was a polysubstance abuser (drugs and alcohol). He routinely used illegal drugs while he held a security clearance. He was arrested three times. He intentionally lied to the healthcare providers throughout much of his earlier substance abuse treatment or aftercare programs; on his security clearance applications in 1999 and in 2011; and to the OPM investigator in 2011. He knew he was violating federal law when he lied, but he “didn’t care.” Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol dependence, chronic sedative/hypnotic use, and cannabis abuse. Despite completing various education and treatment programs in 1990 and 1996, as well as various substance abuse treatment programs in 2009, he resumed his abuse of alcohol and illegal drugs. Applicant’s actions and his changing stories indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. Applicant has been abstinent from drugs since May 2012, and from alcohol since June 2012. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. His most recent effort to demonstrate an intention not to consume any alcohol or use any illegal drugs in the future is unproven until a more substantial period of abstinence is completed. Considering his earlier failures, Applicant’s alcohol dependence and drug abuse may recur, and the uncertainty continues to cast doubt on Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Clearance is denied.

Two layoffs later, he neglected to alter his withholding information. When he filed his 2010 federal income tax return, his liability was higher than anticipated because his mortgage deductions were no longer available to him. Nevertheless, it has been significantly reduced to $599.39. When funds are available, Applicant intends to continue reducing his tax liability.

All of her mother’s savings, life insurance, and health insurance were signed over to the nursing facility. Nearly all of the required paperwork was signed by Applicant as her mother’s representative. However, believing she was using her mother’s power of attorney authority and position, Applicant signed a form furnished by the nursing facility in which she personally guaranteed the payment of all charges incurred for her mother. As a result of that unanticipated additional financial burden, Applicant was unable to keep up with the monthly payments of her own bills. She failed to file her 2005 federal and state income tax returns, and a default judgment on behalf of the nursing facility was entered against Applicant and her mother.

Applicant sought the assistance of a tax attorney and a tax resolution specialist; resolved accounts through his bankruptcy discharges; and resolved other accounts by paying the creditors. The federal tax lien is currently closed, and the state tax lien is in the negotiating process which Applicant hopes will result in a mutually acceptable offer in compromise.

	Applicant is a 28-year old employee of a defense contractor. He failed to file his 2008 and 2009 federal income tax returns as required by law. There was no evidence that the returns were filed by the established April deadlines or by any approved deadline extensions. He attributed his income tax difficulties to the actions of his employers in either furnishing him a Form 1099 rather than a W-2, or furnishing him neither form. He finally filed his 2008 return in August 2012. Applicant used his credit card, but was eventually unable to maintain his monthly payments. The creditor offered to settle the $11,202 balance for $6,721, but the offer was rejected by Applicant. Applicant’s position is that since the creditor has refused to offer him a “reasonable payment plan/settlement offer,” and since the negative account information is already on his credit report, Applicant “will be taking no further action in regard to this issue.” Applicant could have made some more reasonable timely efforts to file his income tax returns and resolve his delinquent credit card account, but he has not done so. Applicant has demonstrated the absence of a meaningful track record in addressing his delinquent credit card account or his federal income tax return-filing responsibilities. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting him cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Clearance is denied.

Applicant reduced his expenses and contacted his creditors and collection agents. He paid off one account, and he is in the process of resolving two other accounts under agreed repayment plans.

	Applicant's good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent bills justifies a finding in his favor under the financial guideline. However, his excessive alcohol consumption and illegal drug use since 1980 has not been mitigated. The intentional falsification of his security application in September 2009 and his interrogatory response in August 2011 is compounded by the poor judgment he demonstrated in threatening his wife and children between 2009 and 2012, and leading to several domestic violence protective orders being filed against him.

She was unable to continue making monthly payments for a number of investment property mortgages, and they became delinquent. Applicant made a business decision and surrendered a number of them as strategic defaults or foreclosures with no delinquency balance owed. Five mortgages were foreclosed upon. She is currently in the process of repaying the loan on the fifth foreclosed property as well as one other property that was delinquent.

	Applicant's financial problems over the years were caused by unemployment, under employment, and her husband's 1989 car accident, rendering him permanently unable to work. In the late 1980s, she stopped paying federal taxes for several tax years. By December 2001, she had 16 delinquent commercial accounts and owed the Government approximately $18,000 in delinquent federal taxes. When the SOR was published in June 2012, Applicant's back federal taxes increased to approximately $30,000. Though she repeatedly claimed that she has been trying to reach a compromise on her federal debt, she has presented no evidence in support of her claim. Her husband's physical problems and her employment difficulties, together with her unexplained medical illness, have been thoroughly reviewed, but are deemed insufficient to fully establish her case in mitigation.
