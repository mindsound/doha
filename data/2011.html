	Fifty-five-year-old Applicant’s financial delinquencies commenced before his lay-off and nearly six-month period of unemployment in early 2009. He acknowledged that before he was laid off in January 2009, his credit cards were getting close to being “maxed out.” He was irresponsible with his spending. His residence went into a foreclosure status and credit cards and charge accounts became delinquent. Even after he was again employed, making an annual salary of $72,000, he resolved only one SOR account (the residence foreclosure that was accepted into the loan modification program) and two non-SOR accounts (the child support arrearage and the HOA arrearage), but he has effectively ignored all of the other accounts. He keeps promising to resolve his delinquent accounts and has made certain assertions about them being in the process of being resolved, but he has submitted no documentary evidence to support his contentions that he has repayment agreements for all of the accounts. Substantial questions and doubts as to his security eligibility and suitability remain.  Clearance is denied.

	Applicant made a decision to stop paying his monthly mortgage payments for his properties. He continued to accrue revenue from the rents generated by his rental properties, and income from his other business enterprise, and was seemingly capable of meeting most of his financial obligations. He simply decided not to pay his mortgages in an effort to force the mortgage lenders to comply with his wishes to lower his monthly payments and otherwise modify all of the mortgages. As a result, he permitted his mortgages to fall into arrears and become delinquent. As for his credit card and other delinquent accounts, Applicant has simply sought to force settlements with the assistance of attorneys. He disputed balances, but since 2008, has refused to pay undisputed amounts. He had $12,000 in savings and $30,000 in stocks and bonds. After paying his expenses, Applicant has a monthly remainder of between $4,000 and $5,000 available for discretionary spending – like paying his mortgages and delinquent debts – but he has refused to do so. Applicant’s actions raise substantial questions and doubts as to his security eligibility and suitability. He has failed to mitigate the continuing security concerns related to his financial considerations. Clearance is denied.

passport to travel to Germany in 2005 and 2006 after he had become a U.S. citizen in
2002. He also voted in a Canadian election in 2004. He has not done so since then, and
has voted in the U.S. presidential election in 2008. In 2006, he consciously decided to use
only his U.S. passport for all travel. He has made 40 to 50 foreign trips in support of the
U.S. Government since then, and used his U.S. passport exclusively. He surrendered his
Canadian passport to his security officer. Clearance is granted.

	The decrease in the value of Applicant's house by $200,000, and the
significant increase in the amount he would be required to pay on his home loans
resulted in Applicant being unable to make his home loan payments. Because of the
decrease in value of the home, it could not be sold in a regular sale, nor would renting
the house allow Applicant to pay the mortgage loans and to pay for rent. Applicant
notified his employer's security officer and vacated the home, immediately when he

	In January 2003, Applicant's credit was excellent, and he started accumulating investment
properties. Commencing in 2007, because of the unexpected downturn in the economy and the housing
market crash, he lost renters when they lost their jobs and were unable to pay the monthly rent. He
continued making his mortgage payments from personal savings. His mortgage lenders would not offer
him any assistance. In September 2007, he stopped paying his mortgages, and he eventually lost several
properties through foreclosure. Applicant's other accounts are either current or in the process of being
repaid. In response to a security clearance application inquiry pertaining to 180 day delinquencies,
Applicant answered "yes," and merely listed two delinquent credit cards, but only referred to his mortgage
problems as having difficulty in renting or selling real estate. He never stated that he had mortgage
delinquencies or foreclosures, and that was a significant omission, especially since the titles to the
investment properties were in his name and not in the name of a separate corporate entity. Applicant failed
to answer the question completely, correctly, and truthfully. His substantial good-faith efforts pertaining to
his finances are sufficient to mitigate those continuing security concerns, but his personal conduct actions
raise substantial questions and doubts as to his security eligibility and suitability.  Clearance is denied.

	Fifty-six-year-old Applicant, a fighter pilot and flight instructor with 49 combat
missions, shoplifted items from a base exchange in March 2000, which he and his
doctor attributed to pain medication-induced absentmindedness. He was disciplined
under NJP, lost his security clearance with access to SCI, and was forced to retire from
active duty. Applicant's loss of the security clearance with access to SCI was
accomplished without his knowledge as he had already taken months of terminal leave.
The evidence failed to show that he deliberately falsified his response on his SF 86

subsequent resignation from a government contractor, amid allegations of inflating
expense reports, has been effectively refuted by Applicant and other witnesses, who

	Twenty-eight-year-old Applicant used, obtained, and transferred the
unprescribed prescription drug Oxycontin from September 2008 until April 2009, when
she was arrested. During all but one month of the period, Applicant possessed a
security clearance. Applicant has abstained from drug abuse for 23 months since her
arrest; eventually disassociated herself from her addict boyfriend; altered her
environment; sought some types of counselling and evaluation; and pledged not to use
Oxycontin or any other controlled substance in the future. Applicant and her LCSW/SAP
characterize her actions as "a single episode" or "an isolated incident," but her course of
conduct was far from being a single episode or isolated incident. That characterization
by Applicant indicates that she has continued to minimize her actions, thereby
increasing concerns. Applicant's period of abstinence is encouraging, but in light of the
foregoing, it is still too brief to suggest that her substance abuse is unlikely to recur or
that it does not cast doubt on Applicant's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.
Substantial questions and doubts as to his security eligibility and suitability remain. 
Clearance is denied.

costly divorce and custody battle with her U.S.-born ex-husband, a battle in which she
prevailed, her assets have significantly diminished. She rents her home, but owns her
automobile and has modest assets. She relinquished her one-quarter share in her
parents' Ukraine apartment, but her youngest minor son retains his one-quarter share,
worth about $10,000, a rather insignificant amount. There is no evidence that Ukraine is

the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 2004. Two years later, financial problems occurred again,
this time associated with lengthy periods of unemployment (December 2006   February
2008) and underemployment (September 2008   December 2008). He failed to keep up
with his monthly payments, and accounts were placed for collection or charged off. In
2007, Applicant forged his father's name on $500 - $600 worth of checks and was

Applicant attributed his financial situation initially to his youthful financial irresponsibility

unemployment. The record is silent as to why Applicant's delinquent accounts largely
remained unaddressed by him after he secured his current employment in April 2009,

unemployment and reduced salaries, as well as unexpected medical expenses. He fell
behind in his monthly payments, and several accounts were placed for collection or
charged off. Although he has $400-$500 available each month for discretionary
spending, his debts have remained in a delinquent status because Applicant ignored
certain creditors for unspecified reasons or because the accounts were not a priority. He
offered little documentary evidence of current, good-faith efforts to pay his creditors
other than promises. Substantial questions and doubts as to his security eligibility and
suitability remain.  Clearance is denied.

	Thirty-two-year-old Applicant's financial situation started to deteriorate in
2006, and his delinquencies were the unfortunate consequence of a devastated
economy, a local housing market, as well as unanticipated medical expenses. He was
unable to sustain himself as a realtor because of the rising gasoline prices, the absence
of qualified buyers, and the stagnant real estate market. Nevertheless, he addressed
the situation and took additional part-time jobs as well as a new permanent position. He

	Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a federal contractor. The evidence shows
he has a long-term history of drug abuse (primarily marijuana) during the period
1996 2009. It began as a way to self-medicate pain he experienced after a serious car
accident in 1996.  His marijuana use continued long after his recovery from his injuries and
became a daily routine. He last used marijuana in about December 2008. He last used
cocaine in about June 2009, a few months before he submitted his application for a
security clearance. His employment history includes being fired, once in 2007, and again
in 2009, for failing drug tests. Although the current short-term trend is favorable, given the
nature, extent, and seriousness of his drug abuse, it is too soon to tell if these matters are
safely in the past. He did not present sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns
stemming from his history of drug abuse. Clearance is denied.
