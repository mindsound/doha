It is not known what Applicant’s financial resources are, or if he has any funds remaining at the end of each month for discretionary use or savings. Thus, there are no indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. Applicant has simply made the assertions that his delinquent accounts were either resolved in 2014, that repayment arrangements had been agreed to, or that other accounts had been removed. In the absence of documentation to support his assertions, little weight can be given to those assertions. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Clearance is denied.

	During his college years, from September 2007 until August 2013, Applicant was a marijuana abuser. He has convictions for simple possession of marijuana (which was in his vehicle but which was not his) in September 2013 and selling alcohol to a person under the age of 21 (while working as a cashier at a grocery store) in February 2011. The alcohol-related incident was actually an isolated incident attributed to either Applicant’s inattentiveness or a system malfunction. With the passage of time, and in the absence of any other alcohol-related incidents, it has minimal security significance. As to the conviction, the marijuana was not his, and it was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Applicant has abstained from marijuana use for nearly one-and-half years, and he intends to refrain from such use in the future. He was candid and forthright in admitting his substance abuse in his e-QIP. His admissions took a degree of courage and maturity, and reflect positive character traits. Under these circumstances, it appears that the indiscretions of his youth will not recur, and the uncertainty regarding Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment has been put to rest.

	Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond his means. Instead, they were largely beyond his control. His initial financial problems started in August 2001 and lasted until January 2004 as a result of unemployment occasioned by job-related injuries. Additional financial problems occurred in September 2005 and October 2005 when his employer sustained Hurricane Katrina-caused damage. When Applicant’s wife’s military deployment ended in 2006, they relocated and he was again unemployed for two months. Applicant apparently overcame those earlier financial problems, only to be confronted by new ones that were also largely beyond his control. His more recent financial problems are attributed to a variety of causes, including the death of his niece’s child, the assistance he gave her with funeral arrangements, her initial inability to pay rent on the house he was renting to her and her family, the increased post-rental agreement mortgage payments, and her subsequent late payments. There was also the misunderstanding regarding the failure to consolidate his student loans, and his mistaken belief that he was making monthly payments for consolidated student loans when, in fact, he was only making payments on one student loan. Applicant has resolved, or is in the process of resolving, all of his accounts. There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. His actions under the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Clearance is granted.

	Applicant’s financial problems were largely beyond his control. In February 2009, Applicant’s employer laid Applicant off and eventually closed the entire department in which he worked, for financial reasons. Applicant remained unemployed until July 2009, and when he obtained new employment, the salary was 20 percent less than his old salary. The lay-off and the reduced salary made it difficult for him to continue making routine monthly payments on some of his accounts. In addition, when Applicant’s unsuccessful investment business was sold, Applicant took responsibility for paying both his and his business partner’s portions of their joint business debt. Applicant did not ignore his debts. Instead, he addressed them. His mortgage was withdrawn from foreclosure status, and with an approved loan modification, the mortgage is once again current. He set up repayment arrangements on the delinquent business account. As a result of the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007, Applicant’s delinquent home equity loan was forgiven, and he no longer has any legal responsibility for it. Applicant has resolved, or is in the process of resolving, all three of his accounts. There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. His actions under the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Clearance is granted.

	<p class="digest">
	In 2013, Applicant received guidance from a financial counseling service to resolve his debts, manage his finances, and save for emergencies. His action plan called for him to immediately pay one account, obtain credit reports and dispute errors in those reports, pay other accounts, and possibly enroll in a debt solver program. As of September 2014, he acknowledged he had not yet followed through on any provision of the action plan. In his answers to the interrogatories, Applicant claimed that he had made payment arrangements with his creditors, but it appears that his claim was untrue. During the three years following his OPM interview, Applicant has taken no action to resolve even the smallest ($35) of his delinquent debts. When Applicant completed his SF 86 and was subsequently interviewed by the OPM investigator, he responded to various questions, but the responses to the questions were, in fact, false. He deliberately falsified his responses in an attempt to conceal the truth about his police record and financial problems. Overall, the evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations and personal conduct. Clearance is denied.

Applicant’s financial problems were in some measure caused by irresponsible spending when he foolishly spent all of his money on a very high-maintenance girlfriend. Once he was gainfully employed, he made little, if any, efforts to pay his creditors, generally ignoring them and allowing the system to obtain funds from him through garnishment. His long-standing failure to repay creditors, at least in reasonable amounts, or to arrange payment plans, reflects traits which raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance.

	Applicant’s history of criminal conduct consists of four alleged incidents involving criminal charges, arrests, or convictions for a variety of actions, and an allegation of inappropriate sexual misconduct not involving police authorities. As to the sexual misconduct, there are no signed, written, or authenticated statements by anyone in authority at the employer attesting to the accuracy or reliability of the witnesses or their respective oral scenarios. There are merely unsigned printed Security Incident Reports. Based on those three documents, the project manager ordered Applicant’s immediate removal from the project. Applicant was not informed or confronted about the allegations by the project manager or anyone else associated with the employer. No further investigation was performed, either by the employer or by any investigative authority, and Applicant was never afforded the opportunity to address or dispute the allegations. When finally informed of the allegations, Applicant steadfastly denied them. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to test the reliability or trustworthiness of the documents submitted. After considering all of the conflicting evidence (Applicant was at work during some of the alleged incidents), I conclude that Applicant’s testimony and signed sworn statements are more reliable than the Security Incident Reports. As alleged in the SOR, there were three alcohol-related incidents that occurred in July 2006 (intoxication), November 2006 (simple assault and drunk and disorderly conduct), and October 2013 (DUI). Applicant has been sober since the last incident. In his SF 86, there were a series of questions about criminal incidents that may have taken place within the past seven years and other questions about criminal incidents that had ever occurred. Although Applicant had been involved in a number of such incidents, he answered “no” to all of those questions. His actions under the circumstances confronting him cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Clearance is denied.

He also falsely denied that he had ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs. In December 2013, he was found guilty. Applicant is 61 years old, and in those years, he has been involved in only this one incident. He has never had any other drug, alcohol, or criminal incidents or problems. Applicant denied intending to falsify his responses and explained that he had simply answered the questions at that time with the wrong mindset that he had not been convicted of any alcohol-related crime and had been assured by his attorney that the charges would be dropped. Upon reflection, Applicant now concedes that he made a mistake in his thinking, and he should have responded “yes” to the questions. Based on his reputation, Applicant’s actions appear to be aberrant behavior. There is substantial evidence of successful rehabilitation: Applicant has complied with his sentence; he has a good employment record; he has expressed genuine remorse; he has reformed his habits; he has assessed the circumstances that resulted in his arrest and conviction, and taken positive steps to avoid such circumstances in the future; and there has been no recurrence of criminal activity, excessive consumption of alcohol, or questionable personal conduct.

When Applicant completed his SF 86, he responded to various financial questions and certified that the responses were “true, complete, and correct” to the best of his knowledge, but the responses to the questions were, in fact, false. He denied the responses were deliberate or an attempt to falsify the material facts. When subsequently asked for explanations for his answers, he furnished a generic, not very credible, template of an explanation covering all of his creditors. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations and personal conduct issues. His actions under the circumstances confronting him do cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Clearance is denied.

Although his current financial situation is partly due to the failure of his business, he did not submit documentation to show that he has responsibly addressed his delinquent debts. He has yet to take control of his finances and it appears highly likely that his poor financial state, and the attendant security concerns raised by his poor finances, will continue for some time. Clearance is denied.

	Applicant’s security violations demonstrated negligence and lack of judgment. Notwithstanding, he changed his behavior and received no additional security violations from November 2008 to June 2011. The most recent security violation was over five years ago. As such, it is temporally remote. Applicant expressed remorse and took responsibility for his actions. He has demonstrated a renewed, positive attitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities.

the Appeal Board. The Judge’s whole-person analysis complied with the requirements of the
Directive. On cross-appeal, Applicant’s settlement agreement between himself and his agency,
with subsequent termination of adverse action, was not sufficient to demonstrate that the
allegations underlying the adverse action were unfounded. The Judge erred in concluding that
the Government failed to meet its burden of production regarding an allegation that Applicant
doctored a certain e-mail. However, given the voluminous record and possible failure of the
Government clearly to identify the document, the Judge probably simply overlooked the

	Applicant was, at one point, living beyond her means. She accumulated nearly $120,000 in consumer debt, and after several years of inability to resolve that debt, her non-student loan debts were discharged in bankruptcy in 2011. Her three-month period of unemployment in 2007 and subsequent reduced earnings were circumstances somewhat beyond her control. Even after her bankruptcy discharge, with the exception of some minor medical debts created in 2013 which she later allowed to become delinquent, Applicant did not make any efforts to address her defaulted student loans. She failed to seek guidance from the U.S. Department of Education or her school financial counselor. Instead, Applicant ignored her creditors, even after she had been questioned by the OPM investigator in June 2013. Her long-standing failure to address her student loans, by either seeking deferment or forbearance, or to arrange payment plans, reflects traits which raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance or a public trust position.

Applicant never contacted his SOR-creditors to try to make repayment arrangements, even for small accounts. Creditors have reached out to him to settle some debts, with one creditor offering a repayment plan of $47.38 per month over 24 months, but Applicant did nothing. Applicant has not acted aggressively, timely, or responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. Instead, he ignored his debts and continues to do so.

	In 2007, Applicant broke his lease and moved across country, using his credit card to pay for moving and living expenses. He had automobile issues. His GI Bill benefits were not used for the designated purposes, and an overpayment resulted. Applicant claimed he had “periods of long unemployment,” but except for his one period from December 2012 until May 2013, he never described any other such periods except while he was a student. Applicant continued to live his life unaffected by most of the above events because of his unrealized expectation that he would receive a large wrongful death settlement pertaining to his deceased sister. Applicant did not make any efforts to pay his creditors, generally ignoring them, even after he had acquired his current position in May 2013. His long-standing failure to repay creditors, at least in reasonable amounts (such as his $92 delinquent account), or to arrange payment plans, reflects traits which raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance or a public trust position. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. Clearance is denied.

At some point, despite having been granted a security clearance, and having been forewarned of the Government’s heightened sensitivity regarding marijuana use, Applicant made a decision to use marijuana for a period of time after being granted a security clearance. As he noted, he should have been mature enough to report himself to his FSO when he made the decision to use marijuana, despite having previously expressed his intentions not to do so.

	Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond his means. His financial problems were substantially beyond Applicant’s control. Commencing in about 2001 - 2002, Applicant started experiencing some financial difficulties when he went through a financially distressing divorce process. He was divorced in 2003. He also incurred unexpectedly large medical bills when he underwent treatment for kidney stones. His main financial problems arose when his employer went bankrupt and in September 2012, Applicant became unemployed. He remained unemployed until April 2013. During that period, some accounts became delinquent, placed for collection, or were charged off. Two accounts went to judgment. Applicant contacted his creditors and, when he was able to do so, he entered into repayment arrangements or settled some accounts for less than the full amount. In an effort to address his remaining accounts, when Applicant obtained his current position, he immediately volunteered for a potentially dangerous overseas deployment to generate additional salary. He has paid off, settled, or otherwise resolved, or is in the process of resolving, nearly all of his accounts, including his non-SOR accounts. There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. There are no questions or doubts as to his security eligibility and suitability. Clearance is granted.

	When Applicant completed and certified a security clearance application, he denied any financial difficulties. He was unaware that he was responsible for a judgment, two accounts in collection status, three accounts in charged-off status, and a significant mortgage delinquency because he had delegated his responsibility to manage his financial affairs to his wife. Applicant’s wife did not pay their debts, and she did not tell him about their delinquencies. Applicant then delegated his financial affairs to his son and future daughter-in-law, who opened a checking account in their names, arranged for Applicant’s paycheck to be deposited to the account, and made all arrangements to pay his debts and manage his finances. Because he had delegated his financial affairs to his wife and to his son and daughter-in-law, Applicant did not know and had not learned how to take care of these responsibilities himself. While Applicant’s failure to report his financial delinquencies on his security clearance application was not deliberate, his failure to take responsibility for and to pay his delinquent debts raises security concerns about his judgment, trustworthiness,  reliability, and ability to protect classified information. While he mitigated security concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, he failed to mitigate security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and the whole-person concept. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.

	When the real estate market crashed, Applicant’s home lost about half of its value. He was financially able to meet his payments, but his attorney advised him to stop paying in order to force the lender to foreclose—a strategic default. Applicant held a security clearance at the time. He stopped payments in 2010, owing approximately $300,000. He has no intent to pay the debt. Applicant’s decision to place his own interests ahead of his duty to meet his financial obligations does not show the reliability and good judgment required of security clearance holders. Clearance is denied.

	Applicant’s initial financial problems arose in 2006 or 2007 when he was deployed and gave his wife his power of attorney. Instead of paying the bills, she opened new accounts. The second wave of financial problems occurred while he was deployed in 2010, when over a six-week period, Applicant’s parents, brother, and brother-in-law all were laid off. With the funds he had hoped to use to resolve his delinquent accounts, he instead diverted them to support his parents, brother, sister, brother-in-law, and his sister’s two children. Applicant put food on the table, made the house payments, utility payments, insurance payments, and car payments for his entire family over a seven-month period. The financial assistance Applicant expended on behalf of his family was overwhelming and resulted in a shortage of available funds, and an inability to address his own accounts. Applicant eventually contacted all of his creditors, and has either already paid off or otherwise resolved most of the accounts, entered into repayment arrangements and is making scheduled payments on other accounts, and disputed other accounts. Applicant demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and elimination, and there are clear indications that his financial problems are under control.
