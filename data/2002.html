	 Applicant, a native of southern India, acquired United States citizenship in March 1995, effectively renouncing his Republic of India citizenship. His continued possession of an Indian passport does not reflect a preference for India, as the foreign passport was no longer valid for travel. Applicant did not report his possession of the passport on his June 2000 security clearance application because it was null and void. While he omitted his past employment in foreign countries from his August 1995 and June 2000 security clearance applications, he had no intent to conceal his employment. There is little risk of foreign influence presented by the foreign citizenship and residency of family members. Clearance is granted.

	 Applicant's personal conduct and finances continue to raise security concerns over her misuse of a credit card that belonged to an elderly client on which she charged over $5,000 in 1998. Aggravating this personal misconduct was her forging a letter of reference for herself from her supervisor for which she was criminally charged and convicted of a misdemeanor. While Applicant has mitigated security concerns over this misdemeanor criminal conduct, she still has not made full restitution and did not begin to make monthly payments to redress this debt until 2000. While she resolved an outstanding debt to one creditor, she has not demonstrated a plan to resolve all her debts nor has she sought counseling to demonstrate that she is gaining control of her finances overall. Despite her remorse, security concerns remain. Clearance is denied.

	 Applicant was born in the Dominican Republic in 1977 and emigrated to the United States when she was nine years old. Before becoming a U.S. citizen in 1998, she had used her Dominican Republic passport for several visits to her native country. Now that she is a U.S. citizen and has a U.S. passport, she intends to use her U.S. passport for all future travel, and she does not intend to renew her expired Dominican Republic passport. While she was initially reluctant to renounce her Dominican Republic citizenship, she expressed a willingness to renounce her Dominican Republic citizenship in the most recent DOHA submission. The security concern raised by members of her family who are not U.S. citizens is mitigated by the fact most of these family members are long-term residents of the United States. Members of her extended family who reside in the Dominican Republic do not live under circumstances where they are likely to be victims of duress. Clearance is granted.

	 Prior to completing her SF 86 (Security Clearance Application) in early January 1999, Applicant, who has lived in the United States since only November 1989 and who speaks English as a second language, had been suspended from employment for misconduct by her previous employer, and had been name a defendant in a complaint and judgment arising from litigation over an automobile accident involving a vehicle stolen from her in July 1997. She answer "no" to questions 20 and 40--that asked her about employment termination under unfavorable circumstances and her involvement in pending civil actions--and credibly testified she had not been terminated by her former employer under adverse circumstances when she completed the SF 86, nor was she aware of the complaint and judgment against her.

	 Security concerns remain over Applicant's foreign preference activated by his dual citizenship and his possession and use of his foreign passport to travel to Lebanon and to protect his financial property interests there. His mere assertion of an exclusive preference for the US is insufficient as he stated that he would not relinquish the passport or his citizenship in Syria. On the other hand, he has mitigated some of the allegations of foreign influence. Although his relatives are citizens of a foreign country, there is no evidence that they have ties to the government, are agents of a foreign power, or could be exploited by a foreign power in a way that would force him to choose between his ties to them and to the US. However, he is clearly influenced by his partial interest in property he owns in Lebanon. Clearance is denied.

	 A native citizen of Portugal, Applicant renewed her Portuguese passport in June 2000 so that she could travel to Portugal to see family members in July 2000. In June 2001, Applicant became a United States naturalized citizen and acquired a United States passport. She has since surrendered her Portuguese passport to the Portuguese consular authority, and has no intent to renew it. While her parents and most of her siblings (brother and four sisters) remain resident citizens of Portugal, and another sister resides in the British Isles, there is little risk of foreign influence presented by the foreign citizenship and residency of these family members. Clearance is granted.

	 Arrested for drunk driving in August 1999 after drinking wine socially at a coworker's home, Applicant completed a diversion program.

	 After being arrested for DUI three times within ten years, most recently in September 1997, and receiving treatment after his two most recent arrests, Applicant answered "no" to questions on the Security Clearance Application (SF 86) designed to elicit information about alcohol abuse and treatment. His explanation for not disclosing his three DUIs is not found persuasive. Although Applicant reduced his alcohol consumption after his second DUI, and reduced it further after his third DUI, he continues to consume as much as six twelve-ounce beers (in a two to three hour period) as often as twice monthly. His history of alcohol abuse is not found mitigate, considering he has been evaluated as alcohol dependent; he admits he likes alcohol and does not intend to stop drinking. Clearance is denied.

While he has a German wife and her children are German citizens, they have no ties to the German government and are not susceptibile to pressure.

This statute prohibits a person so sentenced from holding a security clearance. Clearance is denied. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>

	 Applicant's statements about his intent or state of mind are relevant evidence, but they are not binding on the Administrative Judge. The Judge's finding that Applicant falsified a security questionnaire in November 1998 is sustainable.

Applicant's history of criminal conduct and his falsification of a security questionnaire provide a rational basis for Judge's adverse conclusions about Applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.

Rather, the Judge was required to assess the credibility of Applicant's testimony at the hearing and consider Applicant's written and testimonial explanations in light of the record evidence as a whole. Harmless error by the Judge concerning a finding about the June 1993 incident does not warrant remand or reversal. Although the Judge erred with respect to one aspect of his findings concerning the falsification allegations, the Judge did not err by finding Applicant falsified a security questionnaire in December 1998 and falsified a written statement in February 2000. Favorable evidence cited by Applicant did not compel a favorable security clearance decision by the Judge. Adverse decision affirmed.

Because Applicant disclosed his most recent (October 1998) DUI arrest and other recent adverse information, his failure to disclose two earlier felony charges on his January 2001 Security Clearance Application was found to be the result of carelessness and inattention, rather than a deliberate intent to deceive; he received six month probation and $25.00 fine for the 1975 charge, and the 1997 charge was nolle prosequi.

	 Applicant's 1984, 1989, 1995 and 1996 criminal conduct and his personal conduct in omitting material information from his security forms all raise security concerns. In completing1997 and 1999 security forms, he failed to reveal the 1989 criminal conviction and offered discrepant defenses for this omission. With the 1995 and 1996 charges and guilty pleas, he served consecutive sentences that totaled 480 days. To his credit Applicant was granted an early discharge from sentence in 1998, has a successful work record, moved away from his fixation with guns, and has not subsequently been involved with any criminal activity. This evidence mitigates the 1984 and 1989, but not the 1995-96, criminal conduct. The Smith Amendment (10 U.S.C. Section 986) disqualifies anyone convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for more than one year. Clearance is denied.

An expression of a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country, coupled with an expressed desire to remain neutral if the United States were ever to find itself in conflict with that foreign country, raises serious questions about Applicant's preferences vis-a-vis the United States and that foreign country. Judge erred by analyzing Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 only in terms of whether a foreign country might seek to apply coercive means of pressure or influence to Applicant's family members in a foreign country.
