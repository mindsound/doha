He kept his Moroccan passport and national identity card after becoming a U.S. citizen, but he destroyed them when he learned that they raised security concerns. When he submitted his security clearance application, he failed to disclose two civil actions to which he was a party and some of his foreign travel, because he did not understand the questions.

In 1997 or 2001, he deliberately downloaded and viewed nude and pornographic images of what he believed to be prepubescent girls in provocative poses. As recently as 2007, he downloaded and viewed adult pornography as well as Japanese cartoon images and animations and Hentai images and animations. While there is evidence of credible adverse information provided by Applicant regarding his downloading and viewing of pornographic images of prepubescent females, as well as evidence of his downloading and viewing adult pornography and cartoon pornography, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant deliberately provided false or misleading information concerning the issue of child pornography. To the contrary, with the exception of the actual year in issue (1997 or 2001), Applicant has been consistent in his rendition of the facts. Disagreeing with summarized unverified information in the record is not the same as deliberately lying or recanting what has been characterized as previous “admissions.” There are no significant questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information Clearance is granted.

He had a good income, but he failed to make his quarterly income tax payments, and, instead, made substantial investments in land development, natural gas, and stocks. Several conditions contributed to Applicant’s subsequent financial bind, and they were largely beyond Applicant’s control: the collapse of the real estate market; his partner’s failure to pay Applicant his share of the proceeds from the land development project; the cancellation of a large contract; and his layoff and period of unemployment. In July 2010, Applicant’s delinquent accounts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. His income tax liens were released.

	Applicant’s financial problems commenced with his purchase of a residence in 2006. He remedied those financial problems until March 2010 when he was denied a loan modification and the mortgage lender demanded $10,000. He was unable to pay that amount. The mortgage loan became delinquent and went to a pre-foreclosure status. Applicant put the residence on the market for sale, and watched its value plunge, in part because of the actions of his mortgage lender (including the trashing of the house), and in part because of the devastated economy and local housing market, from almost $200,000 to about $30,000 to $40,000. He tried to avoid foreclosure through HAFAP and a “deed-in-lieu” application. Neither application was approved. He has attempted short sales, but the untimely responses of the mortgage lender discouraged would-be purchasers. He has requested an independent foreclosure review. There are no significant questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Clearance is granted.

The evidence shows Applicant has a history of financial problems consisting of more than 20 delinquent debts for a total of more than $65,000. He was recently successful in obtaining a loan modification on his first mortgage loan, which was past due, but his second mortgage loan remains past due. Otherwise, Applicant presented little in the way of persuasive documentary evidence showing that he is making measurable progress in resolving his financial problems, and the bulk of his delinquent debts remain unresolved.

Four years have passed since Applicant’s misuse of the corporate credit card, and that factor has been considered in his favor. However, the disqualifying evidence outweighs that factor. Also significant are his repeated attempts to conceal his far greater period and frequency of misuse. Applicant’s statement in his e-QIP was false, for in professing a limited misuse over only a one-year period, he attempted to conceal his far greater period and frequency of misuse. During his OPM interview, Applicant again mischaracterized the period and frequency of his misuse. Applicant’s misuse of the corporate credit card and his subsequent, repeated lack of candor are troublesome.

	Applicant held a Soviet/Russian security clearance for a number of years while
working on matters related to Russian national defense. In the Analysis, the Judge cited to
record evidence of Applicant’s ties within the U.S. and within Russia. He also cited to evidence
that Applicant would be willing to renounce his possible dual citizenship. However, because the
SOR did not allege Foreign Preference concerns, this is entitled to limited weight. The Judge did
not explain how it is that cited U.S. ties are such as to mitigate the heightened risk of coercion
that he found to have been raised by Applicant’s circumstances. The record contains evidence
from which a reasonable person could conclude that Applicant’s family and friends might well
come to the attention of the Russian authorities and become a means through which Applicant
could be subjected to coercion. The Judge’s decision fails to consider an important aspect of the
case. Favorable decision reversed.

	Twenty-nine-year-old Applicant’s history includes two instances of criminal conduct. In 2002, when he was about 18 or 19 years old, Applicant was convicted in a special court-martial of wrongful use of methamphetamine, wrongful use of marijuana, and unlawfully carrying a concealed weapon (a knife). He was returned to duty and eventually earned promotions, a Good Conduct Medal, and an honorable discharge. Over the next seven years he was an exemplary employee, praised by superiors and those whose missions he supported. His most recent criminal conduct occurred under unusual circumstances in 2009 when he was convicted of attempted unlawful wounding, and placed on supervised probation for five years unless sooner released. Since his 2009 arrest, Applicant did an assessment of his life and other factors, obtained mental health evaluations, and made changes to his personal habits, including getting more rest and stopping consuming alcohol. He has avoided any subsequent participation in any criminal activity. Applicant’s probation will expire in June 2015, but he will be eligible for early release in December 2012. He is effusively praised by senior officials for his mission critical work. I have no questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Clearance is granted.

income taxes triggered the applicability of Guideline E disqualifying conditions. The Judge’s
conclusion that no mitigating conditions applied is sustainable. The Judge concluded that
essentially the same conduct was mitigated under Guideline B. These Guideline B conclusions
are fundamentally at odds with the Judge’s conclusions under Guideline E, where he stated that
Applicant engaged in questionable recent behavior that placed him in a position of vulnerability
to be exploited by foreign governments. The record evidence supports the Judge’s conclusions
about Applicant’s foreign connections under Guideline E and does not support the contrary
ultimate conclusion under Guideline B. Adverse decision affirmed.

Eventually, the statute of limitations made the debt uncollectable. Applicant invested in two rental properties, hoping to sell the first property and refinance an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) on the second property. The first property was destroyed by arson and Applicant stopped making the mortgage payments when the insurance settlement stalled. He stopped making the mortgage payments on the second property when the ARM adjusted upward and the property value dropped. Both properties were foreclosed, but Applicant remained in contact with the lenders and eventually resolved the delinquent mortgages.

	Applicant has struggled with alcohol for approximately 30 years, and although he has had some periods of sobriety, he has had considerable periods of time when he could not control his alcohol consumption. He has gone to 28-day inpatient programs on two occasions, the most recent, less than three months before the hearing, and he has been to detoxification programs at least four times during the years he has struggled with alcohol. Applicant's alcohol consumption resulted in many instances of him driving a vehicle while he was intoxicated. He also received at least one letter of reprimand from his work related to alcohol. Applicant has been diagnosed by more than one duly qualified professional of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence. No mitigating conditions are applicable. Clearance is denied.

He also is in arrears for child support in the amount of approximately $25,000.  Additionally, Applicant knowingly and wilfully did not furnish accurate information on a 2009 Security Clearance Application, regarding his failure to file taxes returns and his child support arrearage, and it was done in an attempt to mislead the Government.

	Forty-one-year-old Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial considerations. He attributed his financial problems to a low salary, poor money management, his failed marriage, and his initial unawareness of the debt. But, he also admitted he was living beyond his means in 2007 and 2008. He experienced periods of unemployment; his wife was spending too much money; and he moved out of state for unexplained personal reasons. While some of those reasons were largely beyond Applicant’s control (e.g., loss of employment, divorce, and separation), it is difficult to conclude that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant claimed he attempted to contact some creditors, e-mailed other creditors, or was working on payment arrangements with other creditors, but he failed to submit any documentary evidence to support his claims. There is no evidence that Applicant made any effort to resolve these accounts, and they remain unresolved. His actions leave substantial questions and doubts as to his security eligibility and suitability. Clearance is denied.

In June 2010, before the Government knew of his marijuana abuse and before he could be confronted by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant answered a similar question in his SF 86 truthfully. In July 2010, and again in October 2011, when he was interviewed by OPM, he again answered the questions truthfully. Applicant has been characterized as honest and trustworthy by those who know him well. His action in 2005 – seven years ago – in responding falsely to the inquiry regarding marijuana use was clearly aberrant and out of character for him.

Commencing in 2010, some accounts were settled with the assistance of his consumer debt counselor, and he has continued to make his monthly payments to his contractual payment service, which in turn has been making monthly payments to his remaining creditors. There are no questions or doubts as to his security eligibility and suitability. Clearance is granted.

He had recent difficulties, falling behind on his mortgage, but he has been making regular consistent payments to the bank for the last six months as per his agreement with the bank, and he has been paying off his credit cards as well. Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted.

Applicant has not changed or avoided the environment where marijuana was used. In January 2011, Applicant stated that he was considering stopping the use of marijuana completely because he did not want health insurance companies to label him as a smoker. He added that “if it is offered and it is the right time, he will smoke the marijuana.” He subsequently declared his intent to not use marijuana in the future. Under those circumstances, it appears that a more thorough demonstration of intent, supported by a longer period of abstinence, complete disassociation from drug-using associates, and avoidance of the environment where the marijuana was used, is appropriate.

	Applicant mitigated most of his criminal conduct security concerns since they were minor and committed many years ago. However, he did not mitigate a security concern for the May 2010 criminal offense of showing obscene photographs to an underage girl. He is still on probation for this offense. He did not include this offense on his September 2010 security clearance application, so he did not mitigate security concerns for personal conduct. He mitigated security concerns for alcohol consumption since he has not consumed alcohol in over three years and is under medical care for anxiety and stress. Since Applicant has not mitigated all security concern, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
