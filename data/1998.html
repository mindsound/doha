	 As matter of judicial economy, Board can affirm an evidentiary ruling on any proper basis supported by the record, even if the basis was not relied on by the Administrative Judge.

	 Applicant who has worked successfully for a contractor for two years has now successfully mitigated his troubled employment history that he disclosed on his security questionnaire -- fired for withholding money in 1994 and accused of theft in 1996. Initially, the government alleged these two actions under criminal conduct (although he had never been criminally charged for either action). Later it amended and alleged the same actions under personal conduct. He admitted he stole $600 from his 1994 employer, but denied he kept $30 from his 1996 employer or that his intent was theft. While criminal conduct can be asserted even when someone has not been charged, Applicant has now mitigated his 1994 conduct as it was isolated, unlikely to recur, and he is successfully rehabilitated. He repaid the money he took. No criminal conduct occurred in 1996. The personal conduct concerns are now also mitigated as he fully disclosed both incidents and has taken positive steps to make sure this conduct would not recur. Clearance is granted.
