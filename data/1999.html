	 Board rulings are law of the case and must be complied with on remand. Failure to comply with Board rulings denies party of benefit of legal rulings won on appeal and deprives party of right to a new decision in violation of Item 35 of the Additional Procedural Guidance. Judicial discretion must be exercised within the limits set by the Directive and applicable legal principles. A reasonable person could question whether Applicant was denied a fair and impartial determination. Where there is a reasonable doubt regarding either the substance or the appearance of fairness or impartiality, appropriate corrective action must be taken.
