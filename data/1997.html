	 Applicant's repeated criminal conduct of battery in 1983 and again against his former wife in 1992, 1993, and 1995, while serious, can be mitigated as this conduct resulted from the pressures of that relationship and are not likely to recur as he is now divorced and under care of a psychiatrist whose expert opinion that he is rehabilitated is not contradicted. While he was charged in 1995 with threatening a judicial officer in his divorce proceedings, Applicant denied making a real threat; the state placed the charge on the stet docket, ultimately entered a nolle prosequi and expunged the charge.

	 Applicant's three episodes of bank fraud ceased in April 1991, and in the ensuing five years, his criminal conduct has not recurred. His December 1994 plea of guilty resulted in imprisonment, but because he rendered substantial assistance in the investigation and prosecution of others, his prison term was reduced. He continues to exhibit indications of full rehabilitation: has admitted his crimes; is making restitution; abiding by the standard conditions of probation supervision; resumed his place in society and with his employer; and is making continuing contributions to the national security. Clearance is granted.
